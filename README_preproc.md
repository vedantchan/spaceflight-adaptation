General Notes:•	The general processing pipeline is: split  smooth  run analysis•	There are three kinds of data that need to be split: keystroke, shimmer and empatica
	- 	All follow same pipeline, but different code•	For the most part, following the prompts from the code will give you the right output•	Below are the steps to run the script; best to do them in order!
•	**IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT COPYING: 
	-	If you copy the entire folder over (entire trial folder, with all subject folders in it) you NEED to 		make sure the files and folders within it that have a subject name have the SAME subject 			name as the master subject folder (i.e. if your subject folder is name "subj20-missinghead", 		you need to make sure the empatica zipped file is also exactly called "subj20-missinghead", 		and not "subj20" or something else. This is true for shimmer too. 
	- 	If you don't end up copying the whole folder but instead by file, do as the instructions below 		say.Shimmer:1.	Copy ALL shimmer folders at once and put into appropriate raw/subj folder	a.	The zip file should say “(something)-selected.zip”2.	Run SplitTrials_Shim1 >> This runs over ALL subjects	a.	Select your “raw_?” folder	b.	Watch it do its magic	c.	Output: your new split files will end up in a folder called “shimmer/ShimmerSplit”3.	Run R_vector_and_Plots2 >> This runs for EACH subject	a.	Select data/shimmer/subj#/ShimmerSplit		i.	Do it for each subject	b.	Output: there will be a folder called “Vector” for the CSVs for all the vector data, and another 	folder called “Otherplots” that plot everything4.	Run ResampleShim3 >> This runs for EACH subject	a.	Select data/shimmer/subj#/Vector		i.	Do it for each subject	b.	Output: a folder called “Resampled for XCorr” which contains a bunch of csv with resampled 		vector data5.	Run ShimmerEpochAnalysis_acc4 >> This runs for ALL subjects	a.	Select data/shimmer	b.	Output: A folder called ShimEpochAnalysis inside the subject folders containing one CSV per 	body partEmpatica1.	Copy the entire empatica folder into the appropriate “raw” folder2.	Run SplitTrials_Empa1  >> This runs over ALL subjects	a.	Select your “raw_?” folder	b.	Output: within the raw/subj# folder, a folder called “EmpaticaSplit”3.	Create a folder inside data called “smoothed_?”, where ? corresponds to the run name4.	Run SmoothResample2 >> This runs over ALL subjects	a.	Select your “raw_?” folder	b.	Select your “smoothed_?” folder (as prompted)	c.	Output: smoothed data into a “smoothed_?” folderKeystroke1.	Copy text file into the appropriate “raw” folder2.	Create a keystroke folder for the appropriate experiment round, and within that, create a Splitdata 	folder3.	Run TrialSplitting_keystroke >> This runs over EACH subject individually	a.	Select your “raw_?” folder	b.	Select the Splitdata folder (inside keystroke folder)	c.	Enter the subject name (“subj1” etc)	d.	Output: folders within keystroke/Splitdata for each subject, and within each subject folder, 5 	text files for each round4.	Run Keystroke_Epoch_Analysis >> runs for EACH subject	a.	Multi-select the files within keystroke/Splidata/subj#	b.	Select a destination folder (as prompted) >> select the WHOLE keystroke folder	c.	Enter in the subject number (to name the folder, as prompted)	d.	Output: some figures and csvs written into this subject folder	VAN1.	Copy the entire VAN (or VANTAN) folder into the appropriate raw/subj folder2.	Create a folder called “van_[insert mission]” or “vantan _[mission]”3.	Run VANTANanalysis >> This runs over EACH subject individually	a.	Go into the raw/subj/VAN or VANTAN folder and select ALL the files	b.	Follow the next prompt and select the van or vantan folder you just created	c.	Enter the subject you are currently running	d.	Output: one or two files within van_[mission]/subj#/
