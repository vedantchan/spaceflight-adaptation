The Measures of Analysis of Time Series (MATS) toolkit is a matlab-based product that aims at facilitating the computation of a large number of measures of scalar time series analysis on a number of time series. The strength of the MATS toolkit is the simultaneous operation on both multiple time series and multiple measures, allowing a range of measure specific parameters to be set as well. 

The current version of MATS is v1.1 as from 13/1/2019. 
The former version of MATS is v.1.0 as from 12/2/2010. This is the first MATS software as described in 
D. Kugiumtzis and A. Tsimpiris, "Measures of Analysis of Time Series (MATS): A Matlab  Toolkit for Computation of Multiple Measures on Time Series Data Bases", Journal of Statistical Software, Vol. 33, Issue 5, 2010  

To install MATS:
1. Unzip the zipped file MATS.zip and it will create a directory MATS containing all the files you need. 
2. Open matlab and move to the directory MATS (alternatively add this directory and the subdirectory helpfiles to the matlab path, e.g. using the command addpath).
3. Type MATS on the matlab command line and MATS will be launched.

The GUI main window of MATS will appear and you can proceed by loading time series files first. For any operation at any GUI window you can use the 'Help' button to get explanation and guidance information. The help text appears in html and opens on your selected browser.
   
In the MATS directory there are two EEG data files in ascii format (epilepticEEG.dat and normal.dat).

The current MATS v1.1 toolkit should run on any matlab R2010a or newer and for some operations you will need the Signal Processing and Statistics matlab toolboxes. 

The older MATS v1.0 toolkit should run on any matlab version 6.0 or newer and for some operations you will need the Signal Processing and Statistics matlab toolboxes. However, this early version uses external files and may not run properly for newer matlab versions (R2015 and later). 

For users of older matlab than 7.1: before launching MATS v1.0 you should first run the function "changeallfig" giving as input variable the full path of the MATS directory. This function updates all files of .fig type in order to be run by older matlab versions. 

You may want to have a look of the file NewChanges.txt in the same directory. It gives some update of changes made from 2010 onward.
