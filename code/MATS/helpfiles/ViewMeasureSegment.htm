		series, i.e. time series with names containing indices after the character 'S', 
		can be plotted against the segment indices in a figure window. This type 
		of figure allows to track changes in the evolution of measure(s) along 
		the recording epoch split in the time resolution of the duration of each 
		segment. </span>
		<p><span lang="en-us">Two or more segments can be selected from the time 
		series list having the title <b>Select segments of a time series</b>. 
		The segments of a time series are identified by the time series name, 
		the specified parameters of the length of segment (n), sliding steps 
		(s), the character 'B' or 'E' for ignoring remaining data, and the 
		indices after the character 'S' (if there is a string after the index 
		this should be the same in the names of the segments). If no such 
		segments names exist the list of segments is empty and this operation 
		cannot run. Further, one or more measures can be selected from the 
		measure list having the title <b>Select one or more measures</b>. For 
		measures defined in terms of one or more measure specific parameters, 
		the measure name regards a specified set of parameters (one parameter 
		value for each name). A subset of segment and measure names can be 
		selected from the respective lists with standard use of the mouse: a 
		click on a name and Shift^click on a another name further down in the 
		list selects all names between the former and the latter; a click on a 
		name and subsequent Ctrl^clicks on other names select these names 
		including the first name; Ctrl^a selects the whole list. </span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us"><i>Tips</i>: For the selection of a subset of 
		segment time series names from the list, click on the segment time 
		series of this subset appearing first in the list and then Shift^click 
		at the last time series in the list. In this way, all time series from 
		the first selected to the last time series in the list will be marked 
		and from those only the ones that have the same segment time series name 
		as the first and differ only to the segment index will be processed.
