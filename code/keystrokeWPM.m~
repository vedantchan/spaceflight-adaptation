            % correct i think. can check this with word maybe.)
    % - arrow keys that are not followed by backspaces > wrongarrow

            % comes up (b/c consecutive arrow keys isn't technically a

            % has already been accounted for
            
     % penalization: for wrong characters
     % i could penalize only for uncorrected errors (but no way to tell bc
     % no backspace), so makes sense to penalize for backspace AND wrong
     % chars. but that is a lot of penalization. hm.
