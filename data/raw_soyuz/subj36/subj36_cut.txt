Moscow. It took some time to get them ; there;s a big committe that sits down in Moscow and opens the hatch and pulls out things. In the past things have dissappeared and brokem, so a big committee pulls out everything and classifies everything that's supposed to be there, things astronauts brought back. They checked, marked, verified, and certified everything, but when this was all done, more than 15 days after landing I was scarded; I was thinking the reason they are not releasing is because they have screwed up and lost them, but then out they came and it was fine. Phew! 

HIW: Will you, or would you like to, go into space again?

PN: Well, if I had a choise, i would love to go up for another mission. I feel now that I know what's going on up there, so I would love to do things differently, pace myself better, and enjoy things a bit more. The reality is that flight opportunities are scarce and even more so for Europeans - and we have young astronauts that have never flown so It's kind of a situation where many things fo into the decision process. At this point I have been so lucky to realize a dream I've had since I was a kid, and I'm very grateful for that.

- Inspired by the late president Kennedy, in onyl seven years America has risen to the challenge of what he called the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked. After trialing the Russians for years without our manned space program...

... and after that sudden horrible fire on the lauch pad during a routine test that killed American astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee, there were serious doubts that we could beat the Russians to the Moon. But tonight a mere eighteen months after the tragedy of Apollo 1, the entire world watched in awe as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landing on the moon.

[Here is how the movie departs from the actual mission: The fatal launch pad fire occured on January 27, 1967, and the Apollo 11 moon landing on July 29m 1969. Both dates are displayed correctly onscreen, yet walter Cronkite's opening narration says only 18 months ellapsed between them.]
