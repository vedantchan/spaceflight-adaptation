The raccoon, sometimes spelled racoon, also known as the common raccoon, North American raccoon, northern raccoon, or coon, is a medium-sized mammal native to North America. The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to 28 in) and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg (11 to 57 lb). Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates it againt cold weather. Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Raccoons are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years. They are usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating about 40% invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27% vertebrates. 

The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests, but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas, coastal marshes, and urban areas, where some homeowners consider them to be pests. As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also distributed across much of mainland Europe, Caucasus, and japan.

Though previously thought to be generally solitary, there is now evidence that raccoons engage in gender-specific social behavior. Related females often share a common area, while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four animals to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season, and other potential invaders. Home range sizes vary anywhere from 3 hectares (7.4 acres) for females in cities to 5,000 hectares 12,000 acres) for males in prairies. After a gestation period of about 65 days, two to five young, known as "kits," are born in spring. The kits are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersal in late fall. Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years. In many areas, hunting and vehicular injury are the two most common causes of death. 

Etymology
The word "raccoon" was adopted into English from the native Powhatan term, as used in the Colony of Virginia. It was recorded on John Smith's list of Powhatan words as aroughcun, and on that of William Strachey as arathkone. It has also been identified as a reflex of a Proto-Algonquian root "ahrah-koon-em" meaning "[the] one who rubs, scrubs, and scratches with its hands". 

Similarly, Spanish colonists adopted the Spanish word mapache from the Nahuatl mapachtli of the Aztecs, meaning "[the] one who takes everything in its hands". In many languages, the raccoon is named for its characteristic dousing behavior in conjunction with that language's term for bear, for example Waschbar ("wash-bear") in German, HUan Xiong ("wash-bear") in Chinese, orsetto lavatore ("little-bear washing") in Italian, and araiguma ("washing-bear") in Japanese. Alternatively, only the washing behavior might be referred to, as in Russian poloskun ("rinser"). 

The colloquial abbreviation coon is used in words like coonskin for fur clothing and in phrases like old coon as a self designation of trappers. In the 1830s, the United States Whig Party used the raccoon as an emblem, causing them to be perjoratively known as "coons" by their political opponents, who saw them as too sympathetic to African-Americans. Soon after that the term became an ethnic slur, especially in between 1880 and 1920 (see coon song), and the term is still considered offenseive. 

Taxonomy
In the first decades after its discovery by the members of the expedition of Christopher Columbus, who was the first person to leave a written record about the species, taxonomists thought the raccoon was related to many different species, including dogs, caats, badgers, and particularly bears. Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy, placed the raccoon in the genus Ursus, first as Ursus cauda elongata ("long-tailed bear") in the second edition of his Systema Naturae (1740), then as Ursus Lotor ("washer bear") in the tenth edition (1758 - 59). In 1780, Gottlieb Conrad Christian Storr placed the raccoon in its own genus Procyon, which can be translated as either "before dog" or "doglike". It is also possible that Storr had its nocturnal lifestyle in mind and chose the star Procyon as eponym for the species.

Evolution
Based on fossil evidence from Russia and Bulgaria, the first known members of te family Procyonidae lived in Europe in the late Oligocene about 25 million years ago. Similar tooh and skull structures suggest procyonids and weasels share a common ancestor, but molecular analysis indicates a closer relationship between raccoons and bears. After the then-existing species cross the Bering Strait at least six million years later in the early Miocene, the center of its distribution was probably in Central America. Coatis (Nasua and Nasuella) and raccoons (Procyon) have been considered to share common descent from a species in the genus Paranasua present between 5.2 and 6.0 million years ago. This assumption, based on morphological comparisons of fossils, conflicts with a 2006 genetic analysis which indicates raccoons are more closely related to ringtails. Unlike other procyonids, such as the crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus), the ancestors of the common raccoon left tropical and subropical areas and migrated farther north about 2.5 million years ago, in a migration that has been confirmed by the discovery of fossils in the Great plains dating back to th emiddle of the Pliocene. Its mot recent ancestor was likely Procyon rexroadensis, a large Blancan raccoon from the Rexroad Formation characterized by its narrow back teeth and large lower jaw. 

Subspecies
As of 2005, Mammal Species of the World recognizes 22 subspecies of raccoons. Four of these subspecies living only on small Central American and Caribbean islands were often regarded as distinct species after their discovery. These are the Bahamian raccoon and Gaudeloupe raccooon, which are very similar to each other, the Tres Marias raccoon, which is larger than average and has an angular skull, and the extinct Barbados raccoon. Studies of their morphological and genetic traits in 1999, 2003 and 2005 led all these island raccoons to be listed as subspecies of the common raccoon in Mammal Species of the World's third edition. A fifth island raccoon population, the Cozumel raccoon, which weighs only 3 to 4 kg (6.6 to 8.8 lbs) and has notably small teeth, is still regarded as a separate species. 

The four smallest raccoon subspecies, with a typical weight of 1.8 to 2.7 kg (4.0 to 6.0 lb) live along the southern coast of Florida and on the adjacet islands, an example is the Ten Thousand Islands raccoon (Procyon lotor marinus). Most of the other 15 subpsecies differ only slightly from each other in coat color, size and other physical characteristics. The two most widespread subspecies are the eastern raccoon (Procyon lotor lotor) and the Upper Mississippi Valley raccoon (Procyon lotor hirtus). Both share a comparatively dark coat with long hairs, but the Upper Mississippi Valley raccoon is larger than the eastern raccoon. The eastern raccoon occurs in all US states and the Canadian provinces to the north of South Carolina and Tennessee. The Adjacent range of the Upper Mississippi Valley raccoon covers all U.S> states and Canadian provinces to the north of Louisiana, Texas, and New Mexico.

The taxonomic identity of feral raccoons inhabiting Central Europe, Causasia and Japan is unknown, as the founding populations consisted of uncategorized specimens from

Dousing
One aspect of raccoon behavior is so well known that it gives the animal part of its scientific name, Procyon lotor, "lotor" is neo-Latin for "washer." In the wild, raccoons often dabble for underwater food near the shore-line. They then often pick up the food item with their front paws to examine it and rub the item, sometimes to remove unwanted parts. This gives the appearance of te racoon "washing" the food. The tactile sensitivity of the raccoons' paws is increased if this rubbing action is performed underwtaer, since the water softens the hard layer covering the paws. However, the behavior observed in captive raccoons in which they carry their food to water to "wash" or douse it before eating has not been observed in the wild. Naturalist Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, believed that raccoons do not have adequate saliva production to moisten food thereby necessitating dousing, but this hypothesis is now considered to be incorrect. Captive raccoons douse their food more frequently when a watering hole with a layout similar to a stream is not farther away than 3 m (10 ft). The widely accepted theory is that dousing in captive raccoons is a fixed action pattern from the dabbling behavior performed when foraging shores for aquating foods. This is supported by the observation that aquatic foods are doused more frequently. Cleaning dirty food does not seem to be a reason for "washing." Experts have cast doubt on the veractiy of observations of wild raccoons dousing food. 

Reproduction
Raccoons using mate in a period triggered by increasing daylight between late January and mid-March. However, there are large regional differences which are not completely explicable by solar conditions. For example, while raccoons in southern states typically mate later than average, the mating season in Manitoba also peaks later than usual in March and extends until June. During the mating seasons, males restlessly roam their home ranges in search of females in an attempt to court them during the three- to four-day period when conception is possible. These encounters will often occur at central meeting places. Copulation, including forepla, can last over an hour and is repeated over several nights. The weaker members of a male social group also are assumed to get the opportunity to mate, since the stronger ones cannot mate with all available females. In a study in southern Texas during the mating seasons from 1990 to 1992, about one third of all females mated with more than one male. If a female does not become pregnant or if she loses her kits early, she will sometimes become fertile again 80 to 149 days later. 

After usually 63 to 65 days of gestation (although anywhere from 54 to 70 days is possible), a litter of typically two to five young is born. The average litter size varies with habitat, ranging from 2.5 in Alabama to 4.8 in North Dakota. Larger litters are more common in areas with a high mortality rate, due, for example, to hunting or severe winters. While male yearlings usually reach their sexual maturity only after the main maiting season, female yearlings can compensate for high mortality rates and may be responsible for about 50% of all young born in a year. Males have no part in raising young. The kits (also called "cubs") are blind and deaf at birth, but their mask is already visible against their light fur. The birth weight of the about 10 cm (4 in)-long kits is between 60 and 75 g (2.1 and 2.6 oz). Their ear canals open after around 18 to 23 days, a few days before their eyes open for the first time. Once the kits weigh about 1 kg (2 lb), they begin to explore outside the den, consuming solid food for the first time after six to nine weeks. After this point, their mother suckles them with decreasing frequency, they are usually weaned by 16 weeks. In the fall, after their mother has shown them dens and feeding grounds, the juvenile group splits up. While many females will stay close to the home range of their mother, males can sometimes move more than 20 km (12 mi) away. This is considered an instinctive behavior, preventing inbreeding. However, mother and offspring may share a den during the first winter in cold areas.

Life expectancy
Captive raccoons have been known to live for more than 20 years. However, the species' life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years, dpeending on the local conditions in terms of traffic volume, hunting, and weather severity. It is not unusual for only half of the young born in one year to survive a full year. After this point, the annual mortality rate drops to between 10% and 30%. Young raccoons are vulnerable to losing their mother and to starvation, particularly in long and cold winters. The most frequent natural cause of death in the North American raccoon population is distemper, which can rech epidemic proportions and kill most of a local raccoon population. In areas with heavy vehicular traffic and extensive hunting, these factors can account for up to 90% of all deths of adult raccoons. Due to a broad range of range overlap with these predators, the most important natural predators of the raccoon are bobcats, coyotes, and great horned owls, the later mainly preying on young raccoons but capable of kiling adults in some cases. In Florida, they have been reported to fall victim to larger carnivores like American black bear and cougars and these species may also be a threat on occassion in other areas. Also in the southeast, they are among the favored prey for adult American alligators. On occassion, both bald and golden eagles will prey on raccoons. In rare cases of overlap, they may fall victim from carnivors ranging from species averaging smaller than themelves such as fishers to those as large and formdiable as jaguars in Mexico. In their introduced range in the former Soviet Union, their main predators are wolves, lynxes, and eagle owls. However, predation is not a significant cause of death, especially because larger predators have been exterminated in many areas inhabited by raccoons.  

Physics Characteristics
Head to hindquarters, raccoons measure between 40 and 70 cm (*16 and 28 in), not including the bushy tail which can measure between 20 and 40 cm *8 and 16 in), but is usually not much longer than 25 cm (10 in). The shoulder height is between 23 and 30 cm (9 and 12 in). the body weigth of an adult raccoon varies considerably with habitat, making the raccoon one of the most variably sized mammals. It can range from 5 to 2 kilograms (10 to 60 lb), but is usually between 5 and 12 kilograms (10 and 30 lb). The smallest specimens live in southern Florida, while those near the northern limits of the raccoon's range tend to be the largest (see Bergmann's rule). Males are usually 15 to 20% heavier than females. At the beginning of winter, a raccoon can weigh twice as much as in spring because of fat storage. The largest recorded wild raccoon weighted 28.4 kg (62.6 lb) and measured 140 cm (55 in) in total length, by far the largest size recorded for a procyonid. 

The most characteristic physical feature of the raccoon is the area of black fur around the eyes, which contrasts sharply with the surrounding white face coloring. This is reminiscent of a "bandit's mask" and has thus enhanced the animal's reputation for mischief. The slightly rounded ears are also bordered by white fur. Raccoons are assumed to recognize the facial expression and posture of other members of their species more quickly because of the conspicuous facial coloration and the alternating light and dark rings on the tail. The dark mask may also reduce glare and thus enhance night vision. ON other parts of the body, the long and stiff guard hairs, which shed moisture, are

are usually colored in shades of gray and, to a lesser extent, brown. Raccoons with a very dark coat are more common in the German population because individuals with such oloring were among those initially released to the wild. The dense underfur, which accounts for almost 90% of the coat, insulates against cold weather and is composed of 2 to 3 cm (0.8 to 12 in) long hairs.

The raccoon, whose method of locomotion is usually considered to be planigrade, can stand on its hind legs to examine objects with its front paws. As raccoons have short legs compared to their compact torso, they are usually not able either to run quickly or jump great distances. Their top speed over short distances is 16 to 24 km/h (10 to 15 mph) Raccoons can swim with an average speed of about 5 km/h (3 mph) and can stay in the water for several hours. For climbing down a tree headfirst - an unusual ability for a mammal of its size - a raccoon rotates its hind feet so they are pointing backwards. Raccoons have a dual cooling system to regulate their temperature, that is, they are able to both sweat and pant for heat dissipation. 

Raccoon skulls have a short and wide facial region and a voluminous braincase. The facial length of the skull is less than the cranial, and their nasal bones are short and quite broad. The auditory bullae are inflated in form, and the sagittal crest is weakly developed. The dentition  - 40 teeth with the dental formula - is adapted to their omnivorous diet the carnassials are not as sharp and pointed as those of a full-time carnivore, but the molars are not as wide as those of a herbivore. The penis bone of males is about 10 cm (4 in) long and strongly bent at the front end. Juvenile males are distinguished from mature males by the shape and extrusibility of their penis bones. Seven of the thirteen identified vocal calls are used in communication between the mother and her kits, one of these being th ebirdlike twittering of newborns. 

Senses
The most importantsense or the raccoon is its sense of touch. The "hyper sensitive" front paws are protected by a thin horny layer that becomes pliable when wet. The five digits of the paws have no webbing between them, which is unusual for a carnivoran. Almost two-thirds of the area responsible for sensory perception in the raccoon's cerebral cortex is specialized for the thinterpretaion of tactile impulses, more than in any other studied animal. They are able to identify objects before touching them with vibrissae located above their sharp nonrectractable claws. The raccoon's paws lack an opposiable thumb; thus, it does not have the agility of the hands of primates. There is no observed negative effect on tactile perception when a raccoon stands in water below 10 C (50 F) for hours. 

Raccoons are thought to be color blind or at least poorly able to distinguish color; though their eyes are wel-adapted for sensing green light. Although their accommodation of 11 dioptre is comparable to that of humans and they see well in twilight because of the tapetum lucidum behind the retina, visual perception is of subordinate importance to raccoons becaue of their poor long-distance vision. In addition to being useful for orientation in the dark, their sense of smell is important for intraspecific communication. Glandula secretions(usuallly from their anal glands), urine and feces are used for marking. With their broad auditory range, they can perceive tones up to 50 - 85 kHz as well as uiet noises, like those produced by earthworms underground. 

Intelligence
Zoologist Clinton Hart Merriam described raccoons as "clever beasts" and that "in certain directions their cunning surpasses that of the fox. The animal's intelligence gave rise to the epithet "sly coon." Only a few studies have been undetaken to determine the mental abilities of raccoons, most of them based on the animal's sense of touch. In a study by the ethologist H. B. Davis in 1908, raccoons were able to open 11 of 13 complex locks in fewer than 10 tries and had no problems repeating the action when the locks were rearranged or turned upside down. Davis concluded they understood the abstract principles of the locking mechaisms and their learning speed was equivalent to that of mesus amacaques. 

Studies in 1963, 1973, 1875, and 1992 concentrated on raccoon memory showed they can remember the solutions to asks for at least three yeras. In a study by N. Phl in 1992, raccoons were able to instantly differentiate between identical and different symbols three years after the short iiitial learning phase. Stanislas Dehaene reports in his book The Number Sense that raccoons can distinguish boxes containing two or four grapes form those containing three. In research b Suzana Herculano Houzel and other neuroscientists raccoons have been found to be comparable to primates in density of neurons in the cerebral cortex, which they have proposed to be a neuroanatomical indicator of intelligence.

 Urban Raccoons
Due to its adaptability, the raccoons has been able to use urban areas as a habitat. The first sihtings were recorded in a suburb of Cincinnati in the 1920s. Since the 1950s, raccoons have been present in metropolitan areas like Washington, DC, Chicago, and Toronto. Since the 2010s, a nuisance population of raccoons has been present in Albuquerque, New Mexcio. Soince the 1960s, Kassels has hosted Europe's first and densest population in a large urban area with about 50  to 150 animals per square kilometer (130 to 390 animals per squar emile) a figure comparable to thoseof urban habitats in NOrth America. Home range sizes of urban raccoons are only 3 to 40 hectares (7.5 to 100 acres) for females and 8 to 90 hectares (20 to 200 acres) for males. In small towns and suburbs, many raccoons sleep in a nearby forest after foraging in the settlement rea. Fruit and insects in gardens and leftovers inmunicipal waster are easily available food sources. Furthermore, a large number of addiional speeing areas exist in these areas, such as hollows in old garden trees, cottages, garages, abandoned houses, and attics. the percentage of ubran racoons sleeping in abandoned or occupied houses varies from 15% in Washington, DC (1991) to 3% in Kassel (2003). 

Health
Raccoons can carry rabies, a lethal diseases caused by neurotropic rabies virus carried inthe saliva and transmited by bites. Its spread begain in Florida and Georgia in the 1950s and was facilitaed by the introduction of infected individuals to Virginia and NOrth Dakota in the late 1970s. Of the 6, 940 documented rabies cases reported in the United States in 2006, 2, 615 (37.7%) were in raccooons. The US Department of Agriculture as well as local authorities in several US states and Canadian provinces, has developed oral vaccination programs to fight the spread of hte disease in endangered popultions. ONly one human fatality has been reported after transmission of the rabies strain commonly known as "raccoon rabies." Among the main symptoms for rabies in raccoons are a generall sickly appearance, impaired mobility, abnormal vocalization and aggressiveness. There may be no visible signs at all, however, and most individuals do not show the aggressive behavior seen in infected canids, rabid raccoons will often retire to their dens instead. Organizations like the US Forest Service encourage people to stay away fro animals with unusual behavior or appearance, and to nofity the proper authorities, such as an animal control officer fromthe local health department. Since healthy animals, especially nurisng mothers, will occassionally foage during the day, daylight actiity is not a reliable indicator of illness in raccooons. 

Unlike rabies and at least a dozen other pathogens carried by raccoons, distemper, an epizootic virus, does not affect humans. This disease is the most frequent natural cause of death in the North American raccoon population and affects individuals of all age groups. For example, 94 of 145 raccoons died during an outbreak in Clifton, Ohio, in 1968. It may occur along with a folloing inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), causing the animal to display rabies-like symptoms. In Germany, the first eight causes of distemper were reported in 2007. 

 Some of the most important bacterial diseases with affect raccoons are leptspirosis, listeriosis, tetatnus, and tularemia. Although internal parasites weaken their immune systems, well-fed individuals can carry a great many roundworms in their digestive tracts without showing symptoms. The larvae of the roundwor dBaylisascaris procyonis, which can be obtained in the feces and seldom causes  a severe illness in humans, can be ingested whn cleaning raccoon latrines without wearing breathing protection. 

While not endemic, the worm Triechinelia does infect raccoons, and undercookied raccoon meatr has caused trichinosis in humans. Trematode Metorchis conjunctus can also infect raccoons. 

Mythology, arts, and entertainment
In the mythology of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, the raccoon is the subject of folk tales. Stores such as "How raccoons catch so many crafish" from the Tuscarorara cnentered on its skills at foraging. In OTher tales,t the raccoon played the role of the trickster which outsmarts other animals, llike coyotes and wolves. Amon others, the Dakota Sioux believe the raccoon has natural spirit powers, since its mask resembled the facial paintings, two -fingered swashes of black and white, used during rituals to connect to spriting beings. The Aztecs linked supernatural abilities especially to femles, whose commitment to their young was associated witht he roleof wise women in their society. 

The raccoon also appears in Native American art across a wide geographic rane. Petroglyphs with engraved raccoon tracks were found in Lewis Canyon, Texas., at the Crow Hollow petroglyph site in Grayson County, Knentucky and in river drainages near Tularosa, New Mexico, and San Francisco, California. A true to detail figurine made of quartz, the Onto Mound Bilder's Stone Pipe was found ner the Sc

Pet Raccoons
Raccoons are sometimes kept as pets, which is discouraged by many experts because the raccoon is not a domesticated species. Raccoons may act unpredictably and aggressively, and it is extremeley difficult to teach them to obey commands. In places where keeping raccoons as pets is not forbidden, such as in Wisconsin and other US states, an exotic pet permit may be required. One notable raccoon pet was Rebecca, kept by US president Calvin Coolidge.

Their propensity for unruly behavior exceeds that of captive skunks and they are even less trustworhty when alloewed to roam freely because of their intelligence and nimble forelimbs even inexperienced raccoons are easily capable of unscrewing jars, uncorking bottles and opening door latches with more experienced specimens having been recorded to open door knobs. Sexually mature raccoons often show aggressicve natural behaviors such as bititng during the mating season. Neutering them at around five or six months of age decreases the chances of aggressive behavior developing. Racoons can become obese and suffer from other disorders due to poor diet and lack of exercise. When fed with cat food over a long time period, raccoons can develop gout. With respect to the research results regarding their social behavior, it is now required by law in AUstria and Germany to keep at least two individuals to prevent loneliness. Raccoons are usually kept in a pen (indoor or outdoor), also a legal requirement in Austria and Germany. rather than in the apartment where their natural curiosity may result in damage to property.

When orphaned, it is possible for kits to be hrehabilitaed and reintroduced to the wild. However, it is uncertain whether they readapt well to live in the wild. Feeding unweaned kits with cow's milk rather than a kitten replacemnt milk or a similar product can be dangerous to their health.

RECOVERY
The increasing number of racoons in urban areas has resulted in diverse reactions in humans, ranging from outrage at their presence to deliberate feeding. Some wildlife experts and most public authorities caution against feeding wild animals becasue they might become increasingly obtrusive and dependent on humans as a food source. Other experts challenge such argumens and give advice on feeding raccoons and other wildlife in their books. Raccoons without a fear of humans area  aconcern to those who attribut this trait to rabies, but scientists point out this behavior is much more likely to be a behavioral adjustment to living in habitats with regular contact to thumans for many generations. Raccoons usually do not prey on domestic cats and dogs, but isolated cases of killings have been reported. Attacks on pets may also target teir owners. 

While overturned waste containers and raided fruit trees are just a nuisance to homeowners, it can cost several thousand dollars to repair damage caused by the use of attic space as dens. Relocating or killing raccoons without a permit is forbidden in many urban areas on grounds of animal welfare. These methods usually only solve problems with particularly wild or aggressive individuals, since adequate dens are either known to several raccoons or will quickly be rediscovered. Loud noises, flashing lights and unpleasant odors have proven particularly effective in dirving away a mother and her kits before they would normally leave the nesting place (when the kits are about eight weeks old) Typically, though, only precautionary measures to restrict access to food waste and den sites are effective in the long term. 

Among all fruits and crops cultivated in agricultural areas, sweet corn in its milk stage is particularly popular among raccoons. In a two-year study by Purdue University researchers, published in 2004, raccoons were responsible for 87% of the damage to corn plants. Like other predators, raccoons searching for food can break into poultry houses to feed on chicken, ducks, their eggs, or food. 

Since raccoons in high mortality areas have a higher rate of reproduction, extensive hunting may not solve problems with raccoon populations. Older males also claim larger home ranges than younger ones, ersulting in a lower population density. 

Hunting and fur trade
The fur of raccoons is used for clothing, especially for coats and coonskin caps. At present, it is the material used for the inaccurately named "sealskin" cap worn by the Royal Fusiliers of Great Britain. Sporrans made of raccoon pelt and hide have sometimes been used as part of tradiional Scottish highland men's apparel since the 18th Century, especially in North America. Such sporrans may or may not be of the "full-mask" type. Historically, Native American tribes not only used hte fur for winter clothing, but also used the tails for ornament. The famous Sioux leader Spotted Tail took his name from a raccoon skin hat with the tail attached he acquired from a fur trader. Since the alte 18th century, various types of scent hounds, called "coonhounds," which are able to tree animals have been bred in the United tates. In the 19th century, when coonskins occassionally even served as means of payment, several thousand raccoons were killed each year in the United States. This number rose quickly when automobile coats became popular after the turn of the 20th century. In the 1920s, wearing a raccoon coat was regarded as a status symbol among college students. Attempts to breed raccoons in fur farms in the 1920s and 1930s in North America and Europe turned out not to be profitable, and farming was abandoned after prices for long-haired pelts dropped in the 1940s. Although raccoonds had become rare in the 1930s, at least 388,000 were killed during the hunting season of 1934/35. 

After persistent population increases began in the 1940s, the seasonal coon hunting harvest reached about one million animals in the 1946.47 and two million in 1962/63. The broadcast of three television episodes about the frontiersman Davy Crockett and the film Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Fronier in 1954 and 1855 led to a high demand for coonskin caps in the United States, although it is unlikely either Crockett or the actor who played the film, Fess Parker, actually wore a cap made from raccoon furr. The seasonal hunt reached an all-time high with 5.2 million animals in 1976/77 and ranged between 3.2 adn 4.7 million for most of the 1980s. In 1982, the average pelt price was $20. As of 1987, the raccoon was identified as the most important wild furbearer in North American in terms of revenue. In the first half of the 1990s, the seasonal hunt dropped to 0.9 from 1.9 million due ot decreasing pelt prices. 

While primarily hunted for their fur, raccoons were also a source of food for Native Americans and early American settlers. According to Ernest Thompson Seton, young specimens killed without a fight are palatble, whereas old raccoons caught after a length battle are inedible. raccoon meet was extensively eaten during the early years of California, where it was sold in the San Francisco market for $1-3 apiece. American slaves occasionally ate raccoon at Christmas, but it was not necessarily a dish of the poor or rural. The first edition of The Joy of cooking, released in 1931, contained a recipe for preparing raccoon, and US President Calvin Coolidge's pet raccoon Rebecca was originally sent to be served at the White House Thanksgiving Dinner. ALthough the idea of eating raccoons seems repulsive to most mainstream consumers since they see them as endearing, cute, and/or vermin, several thousand raccoons are still eaten each year in the United States, primarily in the Southern United States. 

Range 
Habitat
Although they have thrived in sparsely wooded areas in the last decades, raccoons depend on vertical structures to climb then they feel threatened. Therefore, they avoid open terrain and areas with high concentrations of beech trees, as beec bark is too smooth to climb. Tree hollows in old oaks or other trees and rock crevices are preferred by raccoons as sleeping, winter and litter dens. If such dens are unavailable or accessing them is inconvenient, raccoons use burrows dug by other mammals, dense undergrowth or tree crotches. In a study in the Solling range of hills in Germany, more than 60% of all sleeping places were used only once, but those used at least ten times accounted for about 70% of all uses. Since amphibians, crustaceans, and other animals around the shore of lakes and rivers are an important part of the raccoon's diet, lowland deciduous or mixed forests abundant with water and marshes sustain the highest population densities. While population densities range from 0.5 to 3.2 animals per square kilometer (1.3 to 8.3 animals per square mile) in prairies and do not usually exceed 6 animals per square kilomtee (15.5 animals per square mile) in upland hardwood forests, more than 20 raccoons per square kilomtere (51.8 animals per square mile) can live in lowland forests and marshes.
