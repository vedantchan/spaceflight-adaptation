we invite yo to join us as agents of solidarity. "Puente de solidaridad deirector of mission and identity, Marcela canedo, shared there words with US Missioners and our Bolivian partners during a joint opening ritual for our General Surgery and Neurosurgery mission trips work in Cochabamba this week.
This event was unique in that it began by recognizing the contributions of long time US missioners Richard Moser and Gay Garrett as well as Bolivian partner surgeons, Johnny Camacho and Jaime Vallejos. Puente de Solidaridad pointed to these dedicated surgeons as role models in the important work of building bridges, not walls. Through their many years of mission service, they have built bridges both nationally and internationally, increasing access to safe surgical care for those in greatest need. In addition to recognizing the contributions of veteral missioners, Puente de Solidaridad also welcomed new US missioners and Bolivian partner surgeons present to enter deeply into this mission of solidarity.

Drs. Camacho and Vallejos also shared updates on their recent mobile surgery campaigns - coordinated through Puente de Solidaridad and supported by supply donations from Solidarity bridge - that have given them the opportunity to be missioners in service to their own Bolivian brothers and sisters. Through the use of portable laparoscopic tower, these general surgeons travel with Puente de Solidaridad staff to reach patients who don't have the resources or ability to travel to urban hospitals for surgical care. These campaigns are key to increasing access to safe surgery for people living on the margins and at the same time, they create a space for Bolivian doctors to replicate the mission model of Solidarity Bridge; sharing training and equipment with their colleagues in rural settings.

"This innovative work should be shared with the world."

After listening and learning about the reality of the BOlivian health care system, it was touching to hear the comments of US missioners in support of their Bolivian colleagues. "You should be applauded" Dr. Barbara Lazio, said as she led the roon in a round of applause for the Bolivian practicioners. "This innovative work should be shared with the worlds." said Dr. Moser, speaking of the mobile surgery campaigns. Dr. Moser proposed suggestions for sharing these as a model to be replicated all over the world to reach people in need and expand access to safe surgery.

The US and Bolivian neurosurgery and general surgery mission teams were together again the following day for a celebration at the Viedma Hospital where they celebrated the inaguration of a new laparoscopic tower. This donation was made possible through our partnership with Rotary clubs in Chicago and Cochabamba. It will expand the hospital's capacity to offer minimally invasive general surgeries, which are often safer than open surgery and provide patients with fast recovery times and better outcomes. Faster recovery times, in particular, will allow this busy public hospital to serve many more patients each year.

Dr. Camacho and Vallejos beamed as the visiting surgeons inspected and admired the new equipment. Many Viedma hospital staff gathered around and filled the doorways as Viedma chief of neurosurgery, Dr. Eduardo Amaya, thanked Solidarity Bridge and Puente de Solidaridad for making this crusial equipment donation possible. He assured all those present that these tools would not be taken for granted and would be used to provide healing and hope for many Bolivian families in the years ahead.

As our work continues this week, we are filled with gratitude for the spirit of mission carried in the hearts of all the medical practicioners with whom we work. Wheter US or Bolivian, we have a shared passion for bringing lifesaving medical care to patients in need.

I went often to look at the collection of curiosities in Heidelberg castle, and one day, I surprised the keeper of it with my German. I spoke entirely in that language. He was greatly interested; and after I had talked a while he said my German was very rare, possibly "unique"; and wanted to add it to his museum.

If he had known it had cost me to acquire my art, he would have known that it would break any collector to buy it. Harris and I had been hard at work on our German during several weeks at a time, and although we had made good progress, it had been accomplkished under great difficulty and annoyance, for three of our teachers had died in the mean time. A person who has not studied German can form no idea of what a perplexing language it is.

Surely there is not another language that is so slipshod and systemless, and so slippery and elusive to the grasp. One is washed about in it, hither and thither, in the most helpless way; and when at last he thinks he has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a rest on amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech, he turns over the page and reads, "Let the pupil make careful note of the following excepctions." He runs his eye down and finds that there are more exceptions to the rule than instances of it.
So overboard he goes again, to hunt for another Ararat and find another quicksand. Such has been, and continues to be, my experience. Every time I think I have got one of these four confusion "cases" where I am master of it, a seemingly insignificant preposition intrudes itself into my sentence, clothed with an awful and unsuspected power, and crumbles the ground from under me. For instance, my book inquires after a certain bird -- (it is always inquiring after things which are of no sort of consequence to anybody): "Where is the bird?" Now the answer to this question -- according to the book -- is that the bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on account of the rain. Of course no bird would do that, but then you must stick to the book. Very well, I begin to cipher out the German for that answer. I begin at the wrong end, necessarily, for that is the German idea. I say to myself, "Regen (rain) is masculine -- or maybe it is feminine -- or possibly neuter -- it is too much trouble to look now. Therefore, it is either der (the) Regen, or die (the) Regen, or das (the) Regen, according to which gender it may turn out to be when I look. In the interest of science, I will cipher it out on the hypothesis that it is masculine. Very well -- then the rain is der Regen, if it is simply in the quiescent state of being mentioned, without enlargement or discussion -- Nominative case; but if the rain is lying around, in a kind of a general way on the ground, it is then definiely located, it is doing something -- that is, resting (which is one of the GErman grammar's ideas of doing something), and this throws the rain into the Dative case, and makes it dem Regen. However, this rain is not resting, but it is doing something actively, -- it is falling -- to interefere with the bird, likely -- and this indicated movement, which has the effect of sliding it into the Accusative case and changing dem Regen into den Regen."
Having completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter, I answer up confidently and state in German that the bird is staying in the blackmith shop "egen (on account of) den Regen" Then the teacher lets me soflty down with the remark that whenever the word "wegen" drops into a sentence, it always throws that subject into the Genitive case, regardless of concequences -- and that therefore this bird stayed in the blacksmith shop "wegen des Regens."

N. B. -- I was informe, later, by a higher authority, that there was an "Exception"  which permits  one to say "wegen den Regen" in certain peculiar and complex circumstances, but that this exception is not to be extended to anything but rain.

There are ten parts of speech, and they are all troublesome. An average sentence, in a German newspaper, is a sublime and impressive curiosity; it occupies a quarter of a column; it contains all the ten parts of speech -- not in regular order, but mixed; it is built mainly in compound words constructed by the writer on the spot and not to be found in any dictionary -- six or seven words compacted into one, without joint or seem --  that is without hyphens, it treats of fourteen or fifteen different subjects, each inclosed in a parenthesis of it's own, with here and there extra parenthesis which reinclose three or four of the minor parentheses, making pens with pens: finally, all the parentheses and reparentheses are massed together between a couple of king parentheses, one of which is places in the first line of the magestic sentence and the other in the middle of the last line of it -- after which comes the verb, and you find out for the first time what the man has been talking aabout; and after the verb -- merely by way of ornament, as fdar as I can make out -- the writer shovels in "haben sind gewesen gehabt haben geworden sein." or words to that effect, and the monument is finished. I suppose that this closing hurrah is in the nature of the flourish to a man's signature -- not necessaty, but pretty. German books are easy enough to read when you hold them before the looking-glass or stand on your head -- so as to reverse the construction -- but I think that to learn to read and understand a German newspaper is a thing which must always remain an impossibility to a foreigner.

Yet even the German books are not entirely free from attacks of the Parenthesis distemper -- though they are usually so mild as to cover only a few lines, and therefore when you at last get down to the verb it carries some meaning to your mind because you are able to remember a good deal of what has gone before.
Now here is a sentence from a popular and excellent German novel -- which a slight parentheris is in it. I will make a perfeclty literal translation, and throw in the parenthesis marks and some hyphens for the assistance of the reader -- though in the original there are no parenthesis - marks or hyohens, and the reader is left to flounder through to the remote verb the best way he can:

"But when he, upon the street, the (in-satin-and-silk-covered-now-very-unconstrained-after-the-newest-fashioned-dressed) government counselor's wife met." tc, etc.

Wenn er aber auf der Strasse der in Sammt und Seide gehullten jetzt sehr ungenirt nach der neusten Mode gekleideten Regierungsrathin begegnet.

That is from the Old Mamselle's Secret, by Mrs. Marlitt. And the sentence is constructed upon the most sppoved German model. You observe how far the verb is from the reader's base of operations, well, in a German newspaper they put their verb away over on the next page; ans I have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting preliminaries and parentheses for a column or two, they get in a hurry and have to go to press without getting to the verb at all. Of course, then, the reader is left in a very exhausted abd ignorant state.

We have the Parenthesis disease in our literature, too: and one may see cases of it every day in our books and newspapers, but with us it is the mark and sign of an unpracticed writer or a cloudy intellect, whereas with the Germans it is doubtless the mark and sign of a practiced pen and of the presence of that sort of luminous intellectual fog which stands for clearness among these people. For surely it is not clearness -- it necessarily cannot be clearness. Even a jury would have penetration enough to discover that. A writer's ideas must be a good deal confused, a good deal out of line and sequence, when he starts out to say that a man met a counselor's wife in the street, and then right in the midst of this so simple undertaking halts these approaching people and makes them stand still until he jolts down an inventory of the woman's dress. That is manifestly absurd. It reminds a person of those dentists who secure your instant and breathless interest in a tooth by taking a grip on it with the forceps, and then stand there and dreawl through a tedious anecdote before they give the dreade jerk. Parentheses in literature and dentistry are in bad taste.

The Germans have another kind of parenthesis, which they make by splitting a verb in two and putting half of it at the beginning of an exciting chapter and the other half at the end of it. Can any one conceive of anything more confusing than that? This things are called "separable verbs" The German grammar is blistered all over with separable verbs; and the wider the two portions of one of them are spread apart, the better the author of the crime is poleased with the performance. A favorite one is reiste ab -- which means departed. Here is an example which I culled from a novel  and reduced to English:

"The trunks being now ready, he DR- after kissing his mother and sisters, and once more pressing to his bosom his adored Gretchen, who, dressed in simple white muslin, with a single tuberose in the ample folds of her rich brown hair, ah tottered feebly down the stairs, still pale from the terror and excitment of the past evening, but longing to lay her poor aching head yet once again upon the breast of him whom she loved more dearly than life itself, PARTED."

However, it is not well to dwell too much on the separable verbs. One is sure to lose his temper early; and if he sticks to the subject, and will not be warned, it will at last either soften his brain or petrify it. Personal pronouns and abjectives are fruitful nuisance in this language, and should have been left out. For instance, the same sound, sie, means you, and it means she, and is means her, and it means it, and it means they, and it means them. Think of the ragged poverty of a language which has to make one owrd do the work of six - and a poor little weak thing of only three letters at that. But mainly, think of the exasperation of never knowing which of these meanings the speaker is trying to convey. This explains why, whenever a person says sie to me, I generally try to kill him, if a stranger.

Now observe the Adjective. Here was a case where simplicity wuld have been an advantage; therefore, for no other reason, the inventor of this language, comlicated it all he could. When we wish to speak of our "good friend or friends," in our enlightened tongue, we stick to the one from and have no trouble or hard feeling about it; but with the GErman tongue it is different. When a German gets his hands on an adjective, he declines it, and keeps on declining it until the common sense is all declined out of it. It is as bad as Latin. He says, for instance:

SINGULAR
Nominative -- Mein guter Freund, my good friend
Genitives -- Meines guten Freunes, of my good friend
Dative -- Meinem guten Freund, to my good friend
Accusative -- Meinem guten Freund, my good friend.

PLURAL
N -- Meine guten Freunde, my good friends
G -- Meiner guten Freunde, of my good friends
D -- Meinen guten Freunden, yo my good friends
A. -- Meine guten Freunde, my good freinds.

Now let the candidate for the asylum try to memorize those variations, and see how soon he will be elected.
One might better go without friends in Germany that take all this trouble about them. I have shown what a bother it is to decline a good (male) friend; well this is only one third of the work, for there is a variety of new distortions of th adjective to be learned when the object is feminine, and still another when the object is neuter. Now there are more adjectives in this language that there are black cats in Szitzerland, and they must all be as elaborately declined as the examples above suggested. Difficult? -- troublesome? -- these words cannot describe it. I heard a California student in Heidelberg say, in one of his calmest moods, that he would rather decline two drinks than one German adjective.

The inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure in complicating it in every way he could think of. For instance, if one is casually referring to a house, Haus, or a horse, Pferd, or a dog, Hund, he spells these words as I have indicated; but if he is referring to them in the Dative case, he sticks on a foolish and unnecessary e and spells them Hause, Pferde, Hunde. So, as an added e often signifies the plural, as the s does with us, the new student is likely to go on for a month making twins out of Dative dog before he discovers his mistake; and on the other hand, many a new student who could ill afford loss, has bought and paid for two dogs and only got one of them, because he ignorantly bought that dog in the Dative singular when he really supposed he was talking plural -- which left the law on the seller's side, of course, by the strict rules of grammar, and therefore a suit for recovery could not lie.

In German, all the Nouns begin with a capital letter. Now that is a good idea; and a good idea, in this language, is necessarily conspicuous from its lonesomeness. I consider this capitalizing of nouns a good idea, because by reason of it you are almost always able to tell a noun the minute you see it. You fall into error occasionally, because you mistake the name of a person for the name of a thing, and waste a good deal of time trying to
