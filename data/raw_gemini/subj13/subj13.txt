Manu fled Egypt a little bit at a time. First, he flew to Cyprus, because he knew a travel agent who helped him get a visa. Manu spent a few days in Larnaca, and he got a tattoo in Nicosia, and then he returned to Cairo. The next stop was Saudi Arabia. Visas were easy to get for Egyptians performing the 'umrah pilgrimage, and Manu had a relative in the Country. It may have been the first time in history that a gay man was going to Mecca as part of a plan to escape a Muslim country, but Manu wanted his passport stamped.
At the great mosque of Mecca, he sat alone in the courtyard from midnight until dawn, because he liked the way it looked at night. His given name was Mohamed, and he had been raised Muslim, although he had abandoned the faith long before. Still, he figured that he might as well have the experience of performing the traditional tawaf pilgrimage walk, so he circled the Kaaba counterclockwise seven times, as was customary, and then, for good measure, he made another seven circuits. That was typical: Manu never did anything halfway.
He was one of the first people I met after I moved to Cairo with my family, in the fall of 2011. Earlier that year, during the Arab Spring, President Hosni Mubarak had been overthrown, and Manu translated for me when I reported on protests at Tahrir Square. Later, he took a job as a researcher for the Guardian's Cairo bureau; though we rarely worked together, we became close friends. He was thirty years old, a handsome man with a shaved head and hooded eyes. I didn't know that he was gay until he told me, not long after we met. He remarked that from an early age he had learned to be careful about his appearnace and mannerisms.
His plans for departure were also meticulous. He searched countries that grant asylum to gay people, and Germany seemed the most promising. But it was hard to get a German tourist visa, because of the ongoing refugee crisis. So Manu intended to establish himself as a regular traveller, hoping to reassure the German authorities that he wasn't a risk to overstay his visa. In 2016, during my last year in Egypt, he was trying to convert his savings to U.S. dollars, so I changed money with him whenever I needed local currency. After five years of political instability, the black-market price for dollars was twice the government-set bank rate. Manu wasn't the only Egyptian I knew who was trying to get out.
That June, on the evening before my family returned to our home in Colorado, Manu stopped by around midnight to say goodbye. He laughed when he saw our belongings: fourteen bags, two children's car seats, one double stroller. Some luggage was still only half packed, and my wife, Leslie, and I had hardly slept during the past week. That year, Ramadan fell in June, so business hours were irregular, and even simple tasks took forever. It occurred to me that anybody who saw the mess in the apartment would assume we were the ones fleeing the country.
A couple months earlier, Manu had travelled to Istanbul. Cape Town was next. I wished him good luck, and he offered to help us the next day, but I waved him off. It didn't need to be said: for people like us, leaving Cairo was easy.
A van was waiting at dawn. We arranged it through our usual service, but the driver was new; he seemed unfriendly. He grumbled about the luggage, and, when I tried to instaff the children's seats, I realized that the back seat belts were broken. 
A few friends had come to see us off, including Hany, a driver who had picked up our twin six-year-old daughters, Ariel and Natasha, from school every afternoon that year. His Toyota had working seat belts, and now he offered to take me and the twins to the airport while Leslie accompanied the luggage in the van. On the way, Hany and the girls sang children's songs in Arabic. "Mama zamanha gaya..."
He was softhearted with the twins - a couple days earlier, all three of them had been weeping when they returned from school, because of the impending departure. I realized that the airport drive would be one of our last memories of Egypt, so I filmed them singing on my phone. "Mama is about to arrive..."
The terminal wasn't too busy. At the check-in counter, I looked over our pile of possessions: one double stroller, two children's car 
The the panic - calls to Hany, to the van driver. The two missing bags were carry-ons, and both drivers said that we hadn't left them in their vehicles. I texted Manu and asked him to check with them and with the head of the car service, in case I was missing some detail in Arabic. I telephoned Sayyid, a friend who was the neighborhood garbageman, because he had been at the apartment. Sayyid remebered taking the two carry-on bags out to the curb.
One bag contained my computer, along with two cameras and about eight hundred dollars in foreign currency. My work files were backed up on Dropbox, but I had never been able to synch my phots and videos, because of some problems with our Internet. So I had copied everything twice onto portable hard drives. Leslie had recently made two long research trips, filling a set of notebooks with material for the book about Egypt that she planned to write. Usually, she would have transcribed her notes immediately, but things had been too hectic. I had packed the backup drives and the notebooks in the second carry-on, so that they would be separate from the computer.
First carry-on, second carry-on - it made no difference now. Manu told me that the boss of the car service seemed nervous about the driver. "He said, 'I hired this guy for the first time, and I don't know him,'" Manu reported.
At the airport, a sleepy-eyed officer sprawled in a chair beside the luggage X-ray machine. "You have to contact your embassy," he told Leslie and me. After the U.S. Embassy issued a report, he explained, the police could review security-camera footage.
"But the Embassy isn't open now!" I said. "Wait until it's open."
We pleaded that our flight was about to depart, but the officer offered no solution; he never even stood up from his chair. This was perhaps the worst time to get robbed - most fasting Muslims were recovering from the heavy suhoor meal.

Manu believed that there was no option other than getting the cops to search the building, and he offered to help. Of everybody I contacted - the diplomats, the well connected - the only person who believed he could motivate the Egyptian police was a gay guy in the process of fleeing the country.
When I first met Manu, he rented a run-down apartment with some foreigners in the district of Dokki. It's unusual for an unmarried Egyptian to live apart from family, and Manu's fiver older siblings periodically tried to set him up with a wife, but he found it easy to make excuses. On weekends, he drank heavily in the furtive bars that are scattered around downtown Cairo. He often went to gay pickup spots, like the Qasr al-Nil Bridge, which crosses the Nile to Tahrir. Many of his friends came from predictable groups: liberals, activists, foreigners, other gay men.
But he also associated with people who surprised me. A couple of times, I stopped by his apartment and found him hanging out with a group of police-academy students whom he had met in his neighborhood. They were typical macho, conservative cops, but they enjoyed Manu's company. There was also a young Muslim Brother, a man I'll call Tariq, who came to parties hosted by Manu and his roommates. Everything at these gatherings - the drinking, the presence of homosexuals, the casual mixing of unmarried men and women - should have been anathema to an Islamist. But Tariq was always there, enjoying himself.
Something about Manu's separation from normal society seemed appealing to his ppers. Egypt is hard on young people, in part because there are so many of them - more than sixty percept of the population is under thirty. Jobs have always been in short supply, and there's intense family pressure to marry early. With genders segregated in most communities, sexual repression is a constant weight on people's psyches. Young men in particular often convey an unsettled, slightly volatile air.
Manu, though, had come to terms with some of these pressures earlier in life. He grew up in Port Said, a provincial city at the northern end of the Suez Canal. His father ran a successful coffee shop, but he treated his staff harshly, and at night he tried to relax by smoking hashish. He often beat Manu. The boy had a gift for languages, and he begged to be enrolled in a private English school, but his father refused. So Manu eventually learned English on his own, along with Italian.
In Egypt, most public middle and high schools are separated by gender. As Manu and his male classmates entered their teen-years, their socializing and roughhousing often had a sexual element. Sometimes a boy would act like a girl, in a joking way, and the others would touch and grab him. It wasn't unusual for boys to proceed to more intimate activities in private. Manu because interested in a good-looking classmate, and soon they were having sex. After a couple of years, the relationship ended, and Manu paired off with another boy.
He had no words for what he was doing. In Port Said during the nineteen-nineties, there wasn't a proper Arabic term for a gay person, other than the slur khawwal - "faggot." Shez ginseyan, the more formal term for homosexuality, literally means "sexually abnormal." As far as Manu was concerned, "abnormal" hardly described an activity that, in his estimation, was enjoyed by most of his classmates. With Manu's second partner, sex was intense but silent, and they never discussed it directly. Their private code word was "football." Let's play football, one would say if he was in the mood. The other boy seemed tortured by his desitre, and periodically cut off the relationship. But invariably, over a period of four years, he returned to the code: Let's play football.
He's too trusting," Tariq said. "But he's a good person"

Years later, Manu moved to Cairo in hopes of a more open life, and like most homosexuals in the capital he incorporated the English words "gay" and "straight" into his Arabic. But he distrusted these labels. His experience in Port Said had convinced him that sexuality is more fluid, and idea that has a long history in Egypt. Even that modern slur, khawwal, derives frmo an old term for cross-dressing male dancers. More than a century ago, these figures were popular entertainers at weddings and other events, where they were often seen as sexually available to me. This tradition is long gone, but Manu recognized certain ethos. He believed that if men are surrounded by men, and there's a tacit acceptance of contact, then these men are likely to have sex. Later, because society demands traditional marriage, most of these same men will settle into heterosexual lives.
On vists back to Port Said, Manu sometimes ran into his old high-school partners. Neither of them said a word about what they had shared, although Manu found it easy to talk with the first friend. Now he was married, with small children, and Manu believed that he saw their past relationship as a harmless youthful fling.
The second partner, though, never married or had a girlfriend. To Manu's knowledge, he no longer engaged in sex with men, and he had migrated to work in one of the Gulf states, which are even more conservative than Egypt. A couple times, Manu ran into him in Port Said, and the interactions were awkward. Afterward, Manu felt depressed. He sensed that he friend's desires, which had once been silent but powerful, were not also numbed: no words, no feelings.
Manu e-mailed updates about his search for the stolen bags: Yesterday I went to the airport twice and the police station in Boulak once and the report hasn't been filed yet...
I sent the Orion satellite images, along with a list of items in the bags: some clothes, a pair of sandals, twin pairs of children's shoes, a copy of "The Alexandrai Quartet." The airport police instructed Manu to visit cops in Giza; in Giza, they sent him back to the airport. There was no consensus on what was needed to file a theft report. After more than a week, somebody at the airport finally informed Manu that the authorities scrubbed all security footage on a seven-day cycle. Manu's police-academy friends were of little hlep: I called Bahgat who gave me some contradicting advice, called Magdy who was not at all useful but is trying to look like he is...
I checked the iCloud Web site for a couple of weeks, but nothing appeared. It seemed time to give up, but one morning I logged in for a final look and saw the lbue dot. The iPod was beneath the same Gize rooftop.
Some lawyers told Manu that it might help if Leslie and I received documentation from an overseas government representative, so we started calling the Egytian Consulate in Houston. Meanwhile, Manu kept pushing the cops. He had been targeted by police in the past, and I told him to call the search off if he felt unsafe. But he insisted this was different: now he was the one reporting a crime.
Late one evening in early 2012, Manu was heading back to his apartment when a young man on the street approached him.
During the next few weeks, the lawyer asked Manu for the equivalent of three thousand dolalrs, in orderto bribe officials. After that, he said that hte case was no longer being actively pursued, but it hadn't been dropped. For safety, Manu moved out of Dokki neighborhood. He never learned 

He never learned what had prompted the bust. Perhaps a neighbot had sispected that Manu was gay, or maybe the cops wanted to force Manue to inform on the journalists he worked with. But why didn't the cops follow up? Snd, sfyer Kareen went to all the trouble to entrap Manu, why didn't he appear at the prosecutor's office? Why did the junior officer expose Manu to his fatherand then allow the phone call? Such questions were unansweralbe in a country without any clear system, and where the police had always been defined by incompetence as much as by brutality.
That spring, in 2012 a Muslim Brother named Mohamed Morsi was running to become the first post-revolution President. Taiq was busy wit hthe campaign, but he often checked in on Manu. He never said a word aout his friend's being gay. For a Muslim Brother, the issue should have beenunequivocal: the organization's leaders had declared homosexuality to be a violation of Islam.


I frequently met with Tariq f=during this period, and he believed that Manu had b

I couldn;t tell if Tariq accepted Manu's sexuality or if he just feigned ignorance. People in Egypt often avoided mentioning certain things that seemd obvious, and their behavior could seem contradictory to an outsider. I thought that it probably resulted from the various social pressures: rigid traditons of faith, family structures that could be claustrophobic, and decades of polictcal and economic dysfunction. Soemtimes a person's contradictory behavior felt like hypocrisy, but often it was simply a way to survive a flawed environment. Adn perhaps in  certain cases it represented a form of human decenscy.
In Colorado, I looked at the Orion satellite images evey day, and usually the blue doe was on the Gize rooftop. The buidling sat in the heart of an ashwa'iyat, one the unpanned neighborhoods that are hoe to most residents of greater Cairo. There appeared to be a large water treatment facility nearby, from avove, the round tanks lined up in neat rows like the dots of adomino. The Find My Mac feature even tracked the oPod's bater status I sent updates to Manu:
A diplomat at the Egyptian Consulate in Houston agred to certify a theft description provided that it was written in Arabic and notarized.So Leslie and I went to a notary public in Montrose, Colorado. I don't think I'm supposed to notarize something I can't read, the notary said but she signed int anyway. The Egyptian diplomat stamped it, and I sent it off to Manu.
He kept going to the Cairo airport, and eventually met a a friendly policemmna who put him in touch with the commanding officer at astation near the blue dot. Like some of the cops Manu met, the officer seemed ot think that the iPod Touch was a sophisticated tracking device, and he asked if Apple could request it to photograph the thief's face. He seemed disappointed by Manu's answer, but finally he called together a crew of ten plainclothes coops. All of the mpiled into an old microbus, along with Manu. 
The microbus wound through narrw, dirty streets until it stopped at a dingy laundromat. Stay inside, the commanding officer told Manu. He argued with the owner of the laundromat for a while, and then he returned brandishing a confiscated handgun. Why had the laundry man been armed? How had the cops known? Why hadn't they made an arrest? These were some of the questions that Manu kept to himself. He was using the GPS coordinates from the satellite image to guide the micobus. The vehicle passed the watertreatment plant, and the in came to the building with the blue dot.
The buidling was six stories tall. The officer called Manu and ttwo cops out of the microbus, and they started on the gorund floor, the officer was a big man, and he had a way of stepping forward and wedging his bulk into the entrance whenver somebody answered a door. Manu stood behind him, and for the first time he saw Caito from the police perspective. "We're all good Coptic Christians in this building!" one woman siad, terrified At another aparment, 
The cops clattered up the stairs. A picture of Jesus hiung on the door. The man who answered looked as frightened as his neighbors. Yes, he was a driver. Yes, he sometimes went to the airport. He produced a license - his name was Girgis. Standing inside the doorway, the officer informed the dirver that the police would search the apartment. They showed no warrant of even identification, but the driver didn't resist.
The apartment was large and well appointed. THe driver's wife and two small children were so terrified that Manu had to look away. The officers instructed hi mto help, and althoguh Manu dind't know how t o conduct a perper police search, he opened a closet door and dound a sandle that seemed to match my description. 
Then the ofifcer found an iPod touch sitting on a table he brought it o Manu for 

In 2012, after Manu was arrested, his father called the next day and asked him to come to Port Said. Manu declined, because he knew that the police must have described his sexuality in the crufest of terms. When he was a boy, his mother had tried to protect him from his father's rages, but she had been dead for years. The relationship with his father had never improved. 
Now, though, his father kep calling. I haven't rold anythign to anybody, he said, At last, Manu agreed. His father greeted him warmly, although he never metnioned the arrest.
His heath was declining, and he had lost his business in what he believed to have bee n a coorrupt judgement on a lawsuit. He could have taken out his frustration on Manu, but instead there was a new tenderness in the way that he treated his son. Un. Unlike 
	The father died 
Manu had learned that it was impossible to preduct how people would responcd ponce they learned the truth about his sexuality. Over time, hebecame determined to live more openly in Cairo, depite
Over tim,e he became 
Once, he talked his way out of a police bust at a popular gay hangout, and he had to move out of another apartment after a neighborhood thug threated to knife him fo being a khartawal. Manu asked one of his police academy friends for protection during the move, and he told gim the reason. It didn't seem to bother the young cop and afterward they remained frineds.
Egyptians who didn't consider themselves to be straight often had difficulty characterizing soial attitudes toward homosexuality. One Egyptian in his theirties told me that he had been initiated into sex with men as a teenafer by a cousin, who had given him a reading list of classical Arabic literature that described male couples. "The question startedin my head: Is it wrong or not?" he told me. Like his cousin, he eventually married and had a child, but soemtimes he still help attracted to men. He didn't descrie himself as gay or bisexual, he preferred the English term "queer." He thgoht that his behavior should have been seen as normal. 
In Egypt, the connection between men is much stronger than the connection between men and women," he said.

At piclu sportsts like the Water al al-Nil Bridge, Manu often met men who identified as straight. In a culture where it was difficult to be alone with a woman, they seemed to view the bridge as the best alternative, and thei ideas about what constituted a kharwatal could be idiosyncratic. A man might insist on always being a dominant sexual position because in his mind this didn't qualify as gay.
The only consisteny was silence. No matter what people did, they avoided talking about it. Occassionally, Manu's partners seemed overwhelmed bu guilt, and they lashed out  at hime verbally or phyiscally. Sometimes they even robbed him; over the years, he had three computers and dour cell phones stolen. Manu saw this as an irnevitable risk of meeting people in a culture that was simultaneously homophonic and full of male contact. "The ylove me, they care about me," he explained, "But they also have this thing inside that makes them hate me."
Late one evening in 2014, Manu went to the Qasr al-Nil Bridge and met a young man named Ahmed. Ahmed had a gentle manner, and he talked withManu gor hours, complaining about the things that young men often complained about: klack of job prospects, lack of money, lack of marriage possibilites. Ahmed seemed straight - 
at least by the standards of Egypt," Manu said, which was his usual qualifier. They had sex that evening.
Afterward, they drank beer and talked in Manu's living room. Manu was gazing out the wnidow when Ahmed approached him from behind nd shattered two beer bottles in rapid succession against his head.
There had been no provocation. Later, Manu couldn't even recall what they had been talking about. He remembered that Ahmed came at him with a third, heavier bottle, and somehow Manu fought him off an pushed him out of the apartment. After locking the door, Manu collapsed, bleeding heavily.
He called two foreign friends, who helped him get to the hospital. Manu received stitches, and a scan showed bleeding in the brain. Three days later, Ahmed and another young young man showed up at Manu's apartment door. Ahmed pleased that he wanted to talk, and Manu stood shaking with fear behind the locked door until they left. He had no idea why Ahmed had returned, or why he'd brought a friend - these actions were just as mysterious as the original attack. At the tine, I was 
Ath= the time, I was on a long trip, and when I got back Manu seemed different. His head was scarred, and he had sworn off the Qasr al-Nil Bridge. By that point, the Arab Spring was clearly over in Egypt. THe Muslim Brotherhood's year in power had ended in a coup, and Manu's friend Tariq had left the country, like many other young Islamists. The security state steadily reasserted itself, and, after Abdel Fattah el-Sisi won the Presidency , in 2915, there were increased arrests at Cairo gay hangouts and parties.
Byt then, Manu had made his decision. He still had the police report from his arrest, andi n Cairo, he told his tory to a representative of the UNited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, so that he would have additional documentation. Manu tsold the Port Said apartment and used the cash to pay for his visa trips abroad. In the endm that was the intheritance from his father: a path out of Egypt.
Sfter the pilice discovered out belonging in Girgis's apartment, they fave Manu two options. He could take the bags immediately if he signed a 
And I realized that immediately after the theft, Manu had talked to Hany on the phone, but they hadn't met in person. I sent Manu an e-mail. He responded that he had misspoken - the thief drove a white Toyota sedan, not a van. Hany's Toyota was white, and he was a Copt, too. I e-amiled a photograph of Hany smiling happily with the twins aftera trip home from school. Manu wrote back: that's him. I'm sorry.
I couldnt make sense of the theft. Hany wasn't poor, and I knew he hadn't planned to staeal the bags, because originally the van was going to take all of the us and the luggage to the airport. Hany had a number of regular clients in the neighborhood, and oncein the past I had asked him how he got started. He explained that a woman in our building had left something valuable in his car and he returned it. On a trip back to Cairo, I visited the woman, suspecting that the story was a lie. But she confirmed it- in fact, on a number of occasions Hany had returned things that she'd unknowingly left in his vehicle.
Manu's advice was blunt: you should ruin his life as much as you can, " he said. "Becuase he is a fucking thief." But I wanted to hear Hany's side, so one evening Manu and Iwent to Giza. We passed the gun-toting laundry and the tanks of the water-treatment plant, and we came to the building with the blue dot. I hadn't told Hany taht we were coming. He looked sheepish when he answered the door. 
He seated us in the living room. THe first thing I noticed, sitting atop a bureau, was a framed photograph of Hany with my daughters. The picture hadn't been there when the police made their bust. Now Hany told a story: ONe day, a couple of weeks after we left, a man showed up in the neighborhood with our two bags. Hany took the bags, and he had been holding them for us. He didn't know anything about hte man.
I said that was nonsense; we had evidence that the iPod was in Hany's buidling immediately after the theft, and he must have fiddled with one of the stolen cameras on the sameday, because it contained a short video taken inside his apartment. Manu showed him the satellite images. "We are dealing with devices, not humans," Manu said. "There's no chance of mistake.
"I was waiting for you to send me a message," Hany said. He talked again about the mysterious man with the bags, but now he fixated on the iPod, saying that he had waited patiently for it to be used as a means of comunication. Believe me." he said. It was similar to how the police had seen the device: in everybody's eyes, there was a great power in this foreign object. Hany kept talking about the messages and the mysterious man, but he never admitted his guilt. At last, Manu and I left.
Manu remarked that he wasn't surprised that Hany had taken our bags, because he had been robbed so many  times by people he met a gay hangouts. In my case they consider bme khawwal, so whatever the do is not so bad. Maybe it's the same with because you are a foreigner. He recognized the contradictory behavior: it was possible for somebody to feel genuine affection for children and then rob their parents. And the response to guilt was tortured: it left people unable to acknowledge their actions or even speak about them. Hany must have made a spot decision to steadl the bags, but something prevented him from following thorugh, and for weeks, he slept above the evidence of his crime. WHen I examined the iPod Touch, Iaw that it had been used mostly to access two things on YoutUbe: Coptic Christian hymns and "Tom and Jerry" cartoons
It bothered me that Hany had tried to spread a false story around the neighborhood, so I visited Sayyid and told him the truth. Not long after that, Hany was struck by a car in the street, and he disappeared from the neighborhood. His leg was ruined, Sayyid cheerfully told Leslie, when she was back in Egypt on a research trip. Sayyid said that he and others saw it as divine justice.
an ugly scar ran across the skin, and he wore a brace. Salamtak, I said; Egyptians always say it when somebody is sick or hurt. In the same way, I couldnt' help but ask about Hany' children, and we ended the ehcnage poltelyl. It felt riuzlied, this act of behaivng in publci as if something had never happened.
In Decembere, Manu made his last trip to the Cairo airport . A passpport control officere insteadhis docuemntes. Hay Mohamed, he said, why are you foing to Germany?
Mane said th that he was fivign a lecture, and he handed over an inviation letter. Through some contacts, Mnau 
In Germany, the letter described Manu's topic as LGBT people since the Egyptian revolution. From the way the passport officer stared at the letter, Manu was sure he didn't understand. Finally, the officer asked, ,What are you talking about in Germany? Human rights, Manu said. THe officer waved him through.
In Perlin, Manu attended the discussion, and he visited a lawtyer. He went to a NGO that serves the city's LGBT community. After the Arab spring, launched a new programs for gay refugees. A caseworker gave Manu a letter that identified him as a member of a vulnerable subgroup of the refugee ppopulatin. Next Manu went to a processing center for refugees. The Berlin lawyer had instructded him to say two things.

I'm applying for asylum" Manu told an official, and I'm gay. It was the first time he had ever described huself in such a way to a governemnt representativ.e 
That year more than a half a million refugees arrived in Germany. The system was overwhelmed, and Mnau was shittled to camps in various places. But he asserted contorl whenever possible. At his interview for asylum, the government provided a Tunisian-born Arabic translator, but Manu dismissed the man. He knew that he had the right to choose both the language and the gender of his translator, and he refused to tell his story in his native tongue- he belived that homophobia was too deeply embedded in Arabix. Manu insisted on speajng English thruough a woman.
At some camps, officials tried to house Manu in large open dormitories. THre had been attacks on gay men in such situations, and Mnau always produced the letter fomr the NGO and insisted on more provate housing. Evenutally he was assigned to a site outside olonge, where 96 shipping containers had been converted into housig ro men/
During tha tfirst winter he was ofetn depressed. He hated the gay shipping containers. He shared the space iwth five iraqis who had fled war-torn rural areas.

Eventually, other refugees  
After all the trips, and after all the distance Manu had travelled, he found it exhausting the same word, the same fear. But his resourcefulness was also the same.
Manu immediantely filed an incident report and he applied for government fndng for a pricate apaprtment.
 
He wore hoop earrings and he was strikingly git; even his mannerisms were different: looser, more natural, as if something inside him had relaced. He told me that a gay frined from Cairo had receviely
