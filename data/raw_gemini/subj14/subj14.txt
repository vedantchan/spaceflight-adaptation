	Clarence Rimbro had no objcections to living in the only house on an unihabitated planet, ny more than had any other of Earth's even trillion of inhabitants. 
	If someone had questioned him converning possible objections, he would undoubtedly have stared blankly at th questioner. His house was much larger than any house could possibly be on Earth proper, and much more modern. It had its independent air-supply and water-supply; mple food in its freezing compartments. It was isolated from the lifeless planet on which it was located by a foce-field, but the rooms were built about a five-acre farm *under glass, of course) ehich, un th plane'ts beneficient sunlight, grew flowers for pleasure and vegetables for health. It even supported a few chickens. It gave Mrs. Rimbro something to do with herself afternoons, and a place for th two little Rimbros to play when they were tired of indoors. 
	Furthermore, if one wanted to be on Earht-proper; if one  insisted on it; if one had to have people around, and air one could breathe in the open, or water to swim in - one had only to fo out of the front door of the house. 
	So where was the difficulty? 
	Remember, too, that on the lifeless planet on which the Rimbro house was located there was comple silence except for the occasional monotonous effects of th wind and rain. There was absoluete privacy and the feeling of absolete ownership of two hundred million sqaure miles of planetary surface. 
	Clarence Rimbro appreciated all that in his distant way. He was an accountant, skilled in handling very advanced computer models;precise in his manners and clothing; not given much to smiling beneath his thin well-kept mustache, and properly aware of his own worth. When he drove from work toward home, he passed the occasional dwelling-place on Earth-proper and he never ceased to state at them with a certain smugness. 
	Well, either for business reasons or due to mental perversion, some people simply had to live on Earth-proper. Ot was too bad for them. After all, Earth-proper's soil had to supply for all the trillion of inhabitants (in fifty years, it would be two trillion) and space was at a premium. Houses on Earth-proper just couldn't be any bigger than that; and people who had to live in them had to adjust to the fact. 
	Even the process of entering his house had it ild pleasantness. Rimbro would enter the community twist-place to which he was assigned (it looked, as did all such, like a rather stumpy obelisk) and there he would invariably find other waiting to use it. Still more would arrive before he reached the head of the line. It was sociable time. 
	"How's your planet?" "How's yours?" The usual small talk. Sometimes someone would be having trouble- machinery breakdowsn, or serious weather that would alter the terrain unfavorably. Not often. 
	But conversational cliches passed the time; the Rimbro would be at the head of the line. He would put his key into the slot; the proper combination would be punched; and he would be twisted into a new probability pattern- his own particular probability pattern. This was the one assigned him whenhe married and became a producing citizen- a probability pattern in which life had never developed on Earth. And twisting to this particular lifeless Earth, he would walk into his wn foyer. 
	Just like that. 

	Rimbro never worried about being in another probability; why should he? He never gave it any thought. There were an infinite number of possoble Earths, and each existed in its own niche, its own probablity pattern. Since on a planet such as Earth, there was - according to calculation- about a fifty-fifty chance of life's developing, hald of all the possible Earth's (still infinite, since half of infinity was infinity) possessed life, and half (still infinite) did not. And living on about three hundred billion families, each woth its own beautiful house, powered by the sun of that probablity, and each securely at peace. The number of Earths so occupied grew by millions each day. 
	And then one day, Rimbro came home and Sandra (his wife) said to him, as he entered, "There's been the most pecular noise."
	Rimbro's eyebrows shot up and he looked closely at his wife. Except for a certain restlessness of her thin hands and a pale look about the corners of her tight mouth, she looked normal. 
	Rimbro said, still hoilding his topcoat halfway toward the servette that waited patiently for it, "Noise? What noise? I don't hear anything."
	"It's stopped now." Sandra said. "Really it was like a deep thumping or rumble. You'd hear it a bit, then it would stop. Then you'd hear it a bit, and so on. I've never heard anything like it."
	Rimbro surrendered his coat. "But that's quite impossible."
	"I heard it."
	"I'll look over the machinery," he mumbled. "Something may be wrong."
	
	Nothing was wrong that his accountant's eyes could discover and, with a shrug, Rimbro went to supper. He listened to the servettes hm busily about their different chores, watched one sweep up the plates and cutlery for disposal and recovery, then said, pursing his lips, "Maybe one of the servettes is out of order. I'll check them."
	"It wasn't anything lie that, Clarence."
	Rimbro went to bed, without further concern over the matter- and wakened with his wife's hand clutching his shoulder. His hand went automatically to the contact-patch that set the walls glowing. "waht's the matter? What time is it?"
	She shook her head, "Listen! Listen!"
	Good Lord, thought Rimbro, there is a noise. A definite rumblinf; it came and went. 
	"Earthquake?" he whispered. Such things did happen, of course- though whith all the planet to choose from, one could generally count on having avoided the faulted areas. 
	"All day long?" asked Sandra, fretfully. "I think it's something else." And then she voiced the secret terrot of every nervous householder. "I think there's someone on the planet with us. This Earth is inhabited."
	Rimbro did the logical things. When morning came, he took his wife and children to his wife's mother. He himself took the day off. and hurried to the Sector's housing Bureau. 
	He was quite annoyed by all this. 
	
	Bill Ching of the Housing Bureau was short, jovial, and proud of his part-Mongolian ancestry. He beleived that probablilty patterns had solved every last one of humanity's problems. Alec Mishnoff, also of the Housing Bureau, thought probability patterns were a snare into which humanity had been hopelessly tempted. Mishnoff had originally majored in archeology, and had studied a variety of antiquarian sibjects, with which his delicately-poised head was still crammed. His face managed to look sensitive- despite overbearing eyebrows- and he lived with a pet notion that so far he had dared tell no one, though preoccupation with it had driven him of of archeology and into Housing. 
	Ching was fond of saying, "The hell with Malthus!" It was almost a verbal trademark of his, "The hell with Malthus; we can't possibly over populate now. However frequently we double and redouble, Homo sapiens remains finite in number, and the uninhabited Earhts remain ininite. And we don't have to put one house on each planet; we can put a hundred, a thousand, a million. Plenty of room and plenty of power from each probablity sun." 
	"More than one on a planet?" said Mishnoff, sourly. 
	Ching knew exactly what Alex meant. When probablity patterns had first been put into use, sole ownership of a planet had been a powerful inducement for early settlers. It appealeed to the snob and despot in every one. What man so poor, ran the sloganas not to have an empire larger than Genghis Khan's? To introduce multiple settling now would outrage everyone. 
	Ching said, with a shrug, "All right, it would take psychological preparation. So what? That's what it took to start the whole deal in the first place."
	"And food?" asked Mishnoff.
	"You know we're putting hydroponics works and yeast plants in other probability patterns. And if we had to, we could cultivate their soil."
	"Wearing space-suits and importing oxygen."
	"We could reduce carbon dioxide for oxygen till the plants get going and they'd do the job after that."
	"Given a million years."
	"Mishnoff, the trouble with you," Ching said, "is that you read too many ancient history books. You're an obstructionist."
	
	Ching was too good-natured to mean that, and Mishnoff continued to read books and to worry. Mishnoff longed for the day he could get up the courage necessary to see the Head of the Section and put right out in plain view - bang, like that- exatly what it was that was troubling him. 
	But now a Mr. Clarence Rimbro faced them, perspiring slighyl, and toweringly angry at the fact that it had taken him the  etter part of two days to reach this far into the Bureau. 
	He reached his exposition's climax by saying,"And I say the planet is inhabited and I don't propose to stand for it."
	Having listened to his story in full, Ching tried the soothing approach. He said "Noise like that is probably just some natural phenomenon." 
	"what kind of natural phenomenon?" demanded Rimbro. "I want an investigation. If it's a natural phenomenon, I want to know what kind. I say the place is inhabited; it has life on it, by heaven, and I'm not paying rent on a planet to share it. And with dinosaurs, from the sound of it." 
	"Come, Mr. Rimbro, how long have you lived on your Earth?"
	"Fiftenn and a half years."
	"And has there ever been evidence of life?"
	"There is now, and as a citizen with a production record classified as A-1, I demand an investigation."
	"Of course we'll investigate, sir; but we just want to assure you now that everything is all right. Do you realize ow carefull we select our probability patterns?"
	"I'm and accountant; I have a pretty good idea," said Rimbro at once. 
	"Then surely you know our computers cannot fail us. They neer pick a priobablity which has been picked before; they can't possibly. And they're geared to select only probablity patterns in which Earth has a carbon dioxide atmosphere, one in which plant life, and therefore animal life, has never developed. Because if plants had evolved, the carbon dioxide would have been reduced to oxygen. Do you understand?"
	"I understand it all very well, and I'm not here for lectures," said Rimbro. "I want an investigation out of you, and nothing else. It is quite humiliating to think I may be sharing my world-my own world- with something other or other; I don;t propose to endure it."
	"No, of course not," muttered Ching, avoiding Mishnoff's sardonic glance. "We'll be there before night."

	They were on their way to the twisting-place with fullequipemtn. 
	Michnoff said, "I want to ask you something. Why do you go through that "There's no need to worry , sir" routine? THey always worry, anyway; where does it get you?"
	"I've got to try. They shouldn't worry," said Mishnoff, petulantly. "Ever hear of a carbon dioxide planet that was inhabited? Besides, Rimbro is the type that starts rumors; I can spot them. By the time he's through, if he's encouraged, he'll say his sun went nova."
	"That happens sometimes," said Mishnoff.
	"So? One hourse is wiped out and one family dies. See, you're an obstructionist. In the old times- the times you like- if there were a flood in China, or sompleace, thousands of people would die. ANd that's out of a population of a measly billion or wo."
	Mishnoff muttered, "How do you know the Rimbro planet doesn't have life on it?"
	"Carbon dioxide atmosphere."
	"But suppose-" It was no use; Mishnoff couldn't say it. He finished, lamely, "Suppose plant and animal life develops that can live on carbon dioxide."
	"It's never been observed."
	"In an infinite number of worlds, anything can happen." e finished that in a whisper "Everything must happen."
	"Chances are one in a duodecillion," said Ching shrugging. 
	THey arriced at the twisting-point then, and having  utilized the freight-twist for their vehicle (thus sending it into  Rimbro storage area) they entered the Rimbro probablity pattern themselves. First Ching, then Mishnoff. 

	" A nice house," said Ching, with satisfaction. "Very nice model; good taste."
	"Hear anything?" asked Mishnoff.
	"No."
	Ching wandered into the garden. "Hey," he yelled; "Rhode Island Reds."
	Mishnoff followed, looking up to the glass roof. The sun looked like the sun of a trillion other Earths. 
	He said, absently, "there could be plant life, just starting out. The carbon dioxide might just be starting to drop in concentrations. The computer would never know."
	"And it would take millions of years for animal like to begin, and millions more for it to come out of the sea."
	"It doesn't have to follow that pattern."
	Ching put an arm about his partner's shoulder. "You brood. Some day, you'll tell me what's really bothering you, instead of jst hinting; then we can straighten you out."
	Mishnoff shrugged off the encircling arm with an annoyed frown. Ching's tolerance was always hard to bear. He began, " Let's not psychotherapize- " He broke off then whispered, "Listen."
	Threre was a distant rumble. Again. 

	They placed the seismograph in the center of the room, and activated the force-field that penetrated downward and bound it rigidly to bed rock. They watched the quivering needle record the shocks. 
	Michnoff said, "Surface waves only, very superficial. It's not underground."
	Ching looked a little more dismal, "What is it then?"
	"I think," said Mishnoff, "we'd better find out." His face was gray with apprehension. "We'll have to set up a seismogrpah at another point and get a fix on the focus of disturbance."
	"Obviously," said Ching. "I'll go out with the other seismogrpah; you stay here."
	"No," said Mishnoff, with energy. "I'll go out."
	Mishnoff felt terrifid , but he had no choice. If this were it, he would be prepared; he could get a warning through. Sending out an unsuspecting Ching could be disastrous. Nor could he warn Ching, who would certainly never believe him. 
	But since Mishnoff was not cast in the heroic mold, he as he got inoto his oxygen suit and fumbled the disrupter. as he tried to dissolve the force-field locally in order to free the emergency xit. 
	"Any reason you want to go, particularly?" asked Ching., watching the other's inept manipulations, "I'm willing."
	"It's all right. I'm going out," sai Mihnoff, out of a dry throat, and stepped into the lock that led out into the desolate suface of a lifeless Earth. A presumably lifeless Earth. 

	The sight was not unfamiliar to Mishnoff: he had seen its like domains of time. Bare rock, weathered by wind and rain, crusted and powdered with sand in the gullies; a small and noisy brook beating itself against its stony course. All brown and gray. No signs of green; no signs of life. 
	YEt, the sun was the same; and when night fell, te constellations would be the same. 
	The situation of the dweling plae was in the region which, on Earth-proper would be called Labrador (It was Labrador here, too, really. It had been calculated that in not more than one out of a quadrillion or so Earths were there significant changes in the geological development . The continents were everywhere recognizable down to small details.)
	Despite th situation and the time of the year, which was October, the temperatre was sticky warm due to the hothouse effect of the carbon dioxide in this Earth's dead atmosphere.
	From inside his suit through the transparent visor Mishnoff watched it all somberly. If the epicenter of the noise were close by, adjusting the second seismograph a mile or so would be enough for the fix. If it weren't, they would have to bring in an air-scooter. Well, assume the esser complication to begin with. 
	Methodically, he made his way up the rocky hillside. Once at the top, he could choose his spot. 
	His heart was pounding so that Mishnoff could scarcely hear his own voice as he yelled into his radio mouthpiece, "Hey, Ching, there's construction going on."
	"What?" cam back the appalled shout in his ears. 

	There was no misstake, Ground was being levelled: machinery was at work; rock was being blasted ot. 
	Mishnoff shouted, "THey're blastnig. THat's the noise."
	Ching called back, "But it's impossible. The computer would never pick the probability pattern twice. It couldnt."
	"You don't understand-" began Mishnoff.
	But Ching was following his own throught process. "get over there, Mishnoff. I'm coming out, too."
	"No, damn it; you stay there," cried Mishnoff in alarm. "Keep me in radio contact, and for God's sake, be ready to leave for Earth-proper on wings if I give the word."
	"Why?" demanded Ching. "What's going on?"
	"I don't know yet," said Mishnoff; "give me a chance to find out."
	To his own surprise, he noticed that his teeth were chattering.
	Muttering breathless curses at the computer, at probablilty petterns, and at the insatiaable need for living space on the part of a trillion human beings expanding in numbers like a puff of smoke, Mishnoff slitehred and slipped down the other side of the slope, setting stones to rolling and rousing peculiar echoes. 

	A man came out to meet him, dressed in a gas-tight suit, different in many details from Mishnoff's own, but obviously intended for the same purpose- to lead oxygen to the lungs. 
	Mishnoff gasped breathlessly into his mouthpiece, "Hold it, Ching; there's a man coming. Keep in touch." Mishnoff felt his heart pump more easily and the bellows of his lungs labor less.
	The two men were staring at one another. The other man was blond and craggy of face. The look of surpise him was too extreme to be feigned. 
	He said, in a harsh voice, "Wer sind Sie? Was Machen Sie hier?"
	Mishnoff was thunderstruck. He'd studied ancient German for two years in the days when he expected to be an archeologist; and he followed the comment, despite the fact that the pronunciation was not what he had been taught. The stranger was asking his identity an his business there.
	Stupidly, Mishnoff stammered "Sprechen Sie Deutsch?" and then had to mutter reassurance to Ching, whose agitated voice in his earpiece was demanding to know what the gibberish was all about. 
	The Germant-speaking one made no direct answer. He repeated, "Wer and Sie?" and added impatiently "Hier ist fur ein narrischen Spass kein Zeit."
	Mishnoff didn't feel like a joke, either-particularly not a foolish one- but he continued "Sprechen Sie Planetisch?"
	He did not know the German for "Planetary Standard Language" so he had to guess. Too late, he through he should have referrred to it simply as English.
	The other man stared wide-eyed at him, "Sind Sie wahnsimmig?"
	Mishnoff was almost willing to settle for that; but infeeble self-defense, he said "I'm not crazy damn it. I mean, Auf der Erde woher Sie is gekom-"
	He gave it up for lack of Germany, but the new idea that was rattling inside his skull would not quit its nagging. He had to find some way of testing it. He said, desperately, "Welches Jahr ist es jetzt?"
	Presumably, the stranger- who was questioning his sanity already- would be convinced of Mishnoff's insanity now that he was being asked what year it was; but that was one question for which Mishnoff had the necessary German. 
	The other muttered someonthing that sounded suspiciously like good Germany swearing and then said "Es ist dich drei-und-zwanzig vier-und-sexhzig, und warum-"
	
	The stream of Germany that followed was completely incomprehensible to Mishnoff, but in any case he had enough for the moment. If he translated the German correctly, the year given him was 2364, which was nearly two thousand years in the past. How could that be?
	He muttered "Drei-und-zwanzig vier-und-sechzig?"
	"Ja, ja," said the other. with deep sarcasm. "Drei-un-swanzig vier-und-sechzig. Der ganze Jahr lang ist es so gewesen."
	Mishnoff shrugged. The statement that it had been so all year long ws a feeble witticism- even in German- and it gained nothing in translation. He pondered. 
	But then, the other's ironical tone deepening, the German-speaking one went on, "Drei-und zwanzif, vier-und-sechzig nach Hitler. Hilft das Ihnen veilleicht? Nach Nitler!"
	Mishnoff yelled with delight. "That does help me. Es hilft! Horen Sie bitte-" He went on in broken German, interspered with scraps of Planetary. "For heavens sake um Gottes willen"
	Making it 2364 after Hitler was differnt altogether.
	he put Germany together depserately, trying to explain. 
	The other frowned and grew throughtful. He lifted his gloved hand to stroke his chin, or make some equivalent gesture, hit the trsnsparent visor that covered his face and left his hand there uselessly, while he thought. 
	He said, suddenly, "Ich heiss George Fallenby."
	To Mishnoff it seemed that the name must be of Anglo-Saxon derivation, although the change in vowel form as pronounced by the other made it seem Teutonic. 
	"Guten Tag", said Mishnoff, awkwardly, "Ich heiss Alec Mishnoff," he was suddenly aware of the Slavic derivation of his own name. 
	"Kommen Sie mit mir, Herr Mishnoff," said Fallenby.
	Mishnoff followed with a strained smile, muttering into his transmitter. "It's all right, Ching; it's all right."
	
	Back on Earht-proper, Mishnoff face the Sectors Bureau head, who had grown old in the Service; whose every gray heair betokened a problem met and solved; and every missing hair a problem averted. He was a cautious man with eyes still bright and teeth that were still his own. His was was Berg.
