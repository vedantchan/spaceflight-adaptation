Ralph Solecki, an archaeologist whose research helped debunk the view of Neanderthals as heartless and brutish half-wits and inspired a popular series of novels about prehistoric life, died on March 20 in Livingston, N.J. He was 101. 

The cause was pneumonia, his son William said. 

Starting in the mid-1950s, leading teams from Clumbia University, Dr. Solecki discovered the fossilized skeletons of eight adult and two infant Neanderthals who had lived tens of thousands of years ago in what is now northern Iraq. 

Dr. Solecki, who was also a Smithsonian Institution anthropologist at the time, said physical evidence at Shanidar Cave, where the skeletons were found, suggested that Neanderthals tended to the weak and sounded, and also that they buried their dead with flowers, which were placed ornamentally and possibly selected for their therapeutic benefits.

The exhumed bones of a man, named Shanidar 3, who was blind in one eye and missing his right arm but survived for years after he was hurt, indicated that fellow Neanderthals had helped provide him with sustenance and other support. 

"Although the body was archaic, the spirit was modern" Dr. Solecki wrote in the magazine Science in 1975. 

Large amounts of pollen found in the soil at a grave site suggested that bodies might have been ceremonially entombed with bluebonnet, hollyhock, grape hyacinth and other flowers -- a theory that is still being explored and amplified. (Some researchers hypothesized that the pollen might have been carried by rodents or bees, but Dr. Solecki's theory has become widely accepted.)

"The association of flowers with Neanderthals adds a whole new dimension to our knowledge of his humanness, indicating he had a 'soul,'" Dr. Solecki wrote. 

In addition, he told the New York Academy of Sciences in 1976, if the flowers were confirmed to have been selected for their medicinal value, the discovery would indicate that "the Neanderthals possessed a mutually comprehensive communication system, in short a spoken language."

The very title of Dr. Solecki's first book, published in 1971, made his rehabilitative effort clear. It was called "Shanidar: The First Flower People."

He also wrote "Shanidar: The Humanity of Neanderthal Man" (1972) and, with his wife and fellow archaeologist, Rose L. Solecki, and Anagnosis P. Agelarakis, "The Proto-Neolithic Cemetery in Shanidar Cave" (2004).

Scientists remain awed by what Dr. Solecki discovered and, armed with the latest technology, are still interpreting precisely what the physical evidence of the skeletons and the multiple burials implies. 

"What is clear is that the cluster of bodies at the 'flower burial' came to rest in a very restricted area, but not quite at the same geologic level, and therefore likely not quite at the same time," archaeologist Christopher Hunt was quoted as saying in Science this year. "So that might point to some form of intentionality and group memory as Neanderthals returned to the same spot over generations."

The novelist Jean M. Auel was inspired by Dr. Solecki's research to write "The Clan of the Cave Bear" (1980), the first in her "Earth's Children" series of narratives on the evolution of humankind. Ms. Aeuel said Shanidar 3 was the inspiration for the character Creb. 

In the early 1950s, Dr. Solecki was a Columbia graduate student on another excavation in the mountainous Kurdish region of Iraq. Seeking a potentially fruitful dig site, he was directed by locals to the rugged Great Zab River valley and Shanidar Cave, in the Zagros Mountains.

The cave's portal, 2500 feet above sea level, opened onto a cavernous 3000-square-foot interior with 20-foot-high ceilings, where his discovery of remains and artifacts would make it a singular Neanderthal site in Western Asia.

In 1955, Dr. Solecki married Rose M. Lilien and returned with her to Iraq, where the couple lived in a stone police barracks without running water or toilets.

Their quarters were barely better than the natural cave that Dr. Solecki estimated had been home to some 3000 generations. It provided researchers with what he described as "a consecutive, slow-motion picture" of humanity's evolution. 

"Rarely do archaeologists have a chance to see so clear a succession of man's development over so long a period," he told Scientific American in 1957.

He unearthed the bones in a stratum between 16 feet beneath the surface of the cave and 45 feet below, where the bedrock began.

The first skeleton Dr. Solecki found was of a man who had probably been asleep in the cave when he was struck and killed by limestone rocks loosened by an earthquake.

Another man appeared to have been buried by fellow Neanderthals. A third, excavated in 1957, lived between 35000 and 45000 years ago. He was almost 50 years old and, with signs of a deep cut in his left rib from a pointed stone or blade, might have been the oldest known murder victim. (He is now at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History.)

 When Dr. Solecki and his wife returned again in 1960, they found a fourth skeleton, with evidence of funerary flowers or pollen from herbs possibly used as medicine. 

"Someone in the last ice age must have ranged the mountainside in the mournful task of collecting flowers for the dead," Dr. Solecki wrote. "It seems logical to us today that pretty things like flowers should be placed with the cherished dead, but to find flowers in a Neanderthal burial that took place about 60000 years ago is another matter."

The Neanderthals survived utnil roughly 28000 years ago, when the more adaptable Cro-Magnon population of Homo sapeins began to predominate. 

Stefan Rafael Solecki was born on October 15, 1917, in Brooklyn to Polish immigrants. His father, Casimir, sold insurance. His mother, Mary (Tarnowska) Solecki, was a homemaker.

When he was about 10, his interest in archaeology was piqued by newspaper reports of treasures being unearthed from King Tutankhamen's tomb in Egypt. He began his own excavations after his father bought a house in Cutchogue, N.Y., on Long Island's North Fork. After spring plowing, he and his friends would search for Native American arrowheads and other artifacts. 

After graduating from Newtown High School in Elmhurst, Queens, he received a bachelor of science degree in geology from City College of New York in 1942. 

During World War II he served in the Army in Europe, where he was wounded. He received a master's degree from Columbia University; his thesis was on the 17th-century Fort Corchaug, near the family's Long Island home, which was later designated a National Historic Landmark.

Kelsey Davis was on the verge of dropping out of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University two years ago. Her grades were poor and she felt insecure, doubtful that she belonged at such a prestigious institution. In sorting out her situation, she met with the school's dean, Lorraine Branham, a longtime journalist and, like her, a black woman.

Ms. Branham helped her gain a sense of self-worth and also helped carve a path for her that kept her in the program, Ms. Davis said. Now, at 22, she has already started her own company, CLLCTVE, which helps creative college students find careers, and is about to graduate.

"She advocated for me in ways that made me feel sean, heard and valued,"Ms Davis said in an email. Ms Davis is but one of hundreds of students who turned to Ms. Branham at crucial points in their lives, and to whom Ms. Branham gave direction and encouragement. When Ms. Branham died on April 2 at 66, Ms. Davis said, she understood the meaning of the word "legacy" for the first time.

Most educators dream of making a difference in the lives of their students. As the first woman and first person of color to lead the Newhouse School, Ms. Branham took particular interest in serving as a mentor. She also focused on diversifying the faculty and helping the school keep pace in a fast-changing media world. 

She became dean at a turbulent time for the news media, as the old business models for newspapers were breaking down and broadcast and cable television were being upended by streaming services. "Despite declining student interest in journalism as a career path, she nurtured the newspaper, magazine, broadcast news and photojournalism programs so that they were not lost in a sea of entertainment, advertising and public relations," David Rubin, her predecessor as dean, wrote last week in a tribute to her in The Post-Standard of Syracuse. She was, he said, "the right dean at the right time."

Hub Brown, the school's associate dean of research, creativity, international initiatives and diversity, said in a telephone interview that Ms. Branham was "all about getting us to embrace the future."

"When Apple came out with iPads, she got the faculty iPads and said, 'Work with this and figure out what we can do with it,'" Mr. Brown said. "She saw digital disruption everywhere, and she made sure our facilities were state of the art."

She was also determined to make the school more diverse. Amy Falkner, now the acting dean, said that during Ms. Branham's tenure the percentage of faculty members of color increased to 25 percent from 17, and the percentage of women on the faculty increased to 45 percent from 35. A quarter of the student body is now people of color, and two-thirds of the students are women.

Lorraine Elizabeth Green was born on Dec. 7, 1952, in Philadelphia to Jesse Williams, a tavern owner, and Leona Green. Her parents split up when she was young, and she was raised by her mother and her stepfather, Henry Walls, a mechanic. She was the oldest of nine children on her mother's side and the oldest of four on her father's.

 She was married twice, first to Norris Branham, with whom she had a son, and then to Melvin Williams, whom she met at the Atlanta airport in 1991 when she sat down right next to him at a bank of otherwise unused pay phones. She did not change her surname when she married Mr. Williams.

Ms. Branham, who lived outside Syracuse, died of uterine cancer at a hospital in Rochester, her sister Annette Walls-McLaurin said.

In addition to her sister, she is survived by her husband; her son, Norris; and a granddaughter. She is survived on her mother's side by her sisters Connie Walls-Presley, Henretta Ladson, Carol Ann Walls and Leona Walls, and her brothers Henry Jr., Averell and Vincent Walls. On her father's side, she is survived by her sisters Elaine and Gisell Williams and her brother Kenneth Williams. 

An early influence on her was Ed Bradley, the longtime "60 Minutes" correspondent, who started out as a public-school teacher in Philadelphia and was her sixth-grade teacher. They stayed in touch, and, seeing that she was a good writer and curious about current affairs, he encouraged her to pursue a career in journalism.

After she graduated from Overbrook High School in Philadelphia she remained in the city to attend Temple University, where she majored in radio, television and film, graduating in 1976. She was a John. S Knight Fellow at Stanford in 1985-86.

Ms. Branham began her reporting career with The Philadelphia Tribune in 1976, then moved to other reporting and editing jobs at The Courier-Post in Camden, N.J., The Philadelphia Bulletin and The Baltimore Sun before joining The Philadelphia Inquirer as an editor in 1987. She rose through the newspaper's management ranks, including stints as New Jersey editor and associate managing editor for features.

As New Jersey editor, Ms. Branham often represented The Inquirer at business and civic functions and lamented that she usually stood out as the only person of color - "like flies in buttermilk," she used to say, according to Daniel R. Biddle, who was her deputy in New Jersey.

"She said it with a weariness and thick skin and humor," Mr. Biddle, who is white, said in an email. "She used the same tone when politicians or other people would walk into the New Jersey bureau and see her and see me, and say to her, 'Can I talk to your boss?' And Lorraine would say in that same voice, 'I am the boss.'"

She left The Inquirer in 1996 to become executive director of The Tallahassee Democrat in Florida; she was the first woman and first African-American in that position. She then moved to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, where she was assistant to the publisher from 2000 to 2002.

That was her last newspaper job before she turned to academia. She was director of the school of journalism at the University of Texas at Austin from 2002 to 2008, when she became dean at the Newhouse School. She was chosen from a field of 300 applicants.

At Syracuse, Ms. Branham led an $18 million fund-raising campaign and created the Newhouse Studio and Innovation Center, which includes the Dick Clark Studios and the Alan Gerry Center for Media Innovation. During her tenure, the school established the Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship, the Peter A. Horvitz Endowed Chair in Journalism Innovation and the Newhouse Sports Media Center. She also helped establish satellite campus programs in New York and Los Angeles.

In a statement, Donald Newhouse, son of the school's founder, said that Ms. Branham had taken "a great school and with a monumental effort remolded it to keep it relevant to a world that is ocnstantly in flux." 

Mountain lions sure are in the news a lot, right? There was the deadly attack outside Seattle lsat May, the woman who was killed on Mount Hood, in Oregon, in October, then the Colorado jogger who killed a cougar with his bare hands in February, and now a mom on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, who saved her son from a hungry cat. Are these incidents connected or part of a larger trend?

"What we're seeing is a statistical anomaly,
 says Lynn Cullens, executive director of the Mountain Lion Foundation, a conservation group. She says that attacks by the cat are so rare that we simply don't have good data on them.

In the past 100 years, there have been fewer than two dozen fatal cougar attacks in North America. Before the current swarm of events, there hadn't been a fatal attack on this continent since 2008. Suddenly, in the last year, there have been two, which, according to Cullens, may feel like a trend but "just isn't."

There may be more mountain lions in the woods today than there were just a few decades ago. When Europeans began settling the continent, they saw cougars as both competition for game and a threat to their own lives. Unregulated market hunting and bounties for dead cats eventually extirpated mountain lions, which had once roamed the entire lower 48, from most of the East Coast outside of Florida. By the mid-1900s, mountain lions lived in only a few isolated pockets of territory in the Rocky Mountains and westward. Conservation efforts created protections for the species, which has slowly been returning to more of its historic range. 

Cullens notes that efforts to count mountain lion populations remain rudimentary and are frustrated by the shy nature of the cats. The Mountain Lion Foundation estimates that there may currently be only 30,000 cougars in the U.S.

It should be noted that populations of ountain lions don't grow denser as their numbers expand. Mountain lions are territorial, claiming areas that run from 10 to 370 square miles in size (depending on the ecosystem in question.) So expanding mountain lion numbers don't mean there are more cats in the woods; it means there are lions in places there weren't before.

Even as mountain lions are reoccupying more and more of their historic range, humans are moving into it. Since 1990, 60 percent of new homes built in western states have been built in something called the wildland-urban interface (read: areas with natural beauty). If you live somewhere with deer, then you live in current or potential cougar habitat.

In addition to all those new homes, humans are also going outdoors in record numbers. In 1979, 198 million people visited national parks. In 2018, that number was 318 million. And if you're camping somewhere with deer -- the cats' preferred diet -- you're camping somewhere that's current or potential cougar habitat. 

Cullens says that all of the recent headlines have been created by juvenile cougars. 
The only time that you'll see an increase in cougar population density is if young cats are dispersed there,
 she says.

The Pro's Closet (TPC) isn't your average web-based bike shop. It has an innovative certified pre-owned (CPO) program, an inventory of used bikes in great condition at a discount, and a system that allows customers to sell those bikes back for predetermined prices at six-, 12-, and 18-month intervals. Customers can pocket that cash or use to to trade up for their next ride. "Bike technology moves so fast right now. You buy a bike, and there's a new one coming out ready to replace it.

More than half of TPC's inventory has pre-owned certification. To earn it, a bike has to pass a 141-point inspection at the hands of a mechanic, including everything from the condition of the paint job to how much play is in the frame pivots.

upgrades."

Martin started the Pro's Closet in 2006. Recently retired from professional cycling, he was trying to downsize by selling all the lightly used gear he had received from his sponsors. Martin turned that ingenuity into an eBay retail business that grew to become th elargest bike seller on the platform. The Boulder-based company raised $9 million in investor funds in 2017, expanded to its own website, and launched the certified pre-owned and guaranteed buy back program in early 2019.

There are more than 300 bikes on the site right now, from road racers and gravel grinders to downhill mountain bikes and cross-country speedsters. Prices run from $500 for a Specialized Rockhopper Comp to $8299 for a carbon Pinarello F100 and can be as much as The bikes on the site that don't make it into the CPO category might be discounted a few hundred dollaars more because of their condition and age. (The Pro's Closet won't certify anything older than four years.)

Our entire model is based on trust and trasparency," Martin says. "We're trying to take the risk out of the secondhand market, so you don't have to meet someone in a parking lot to get a good deal on a bike."

Martin set me up with a trial run of the Pro's Closet service, and I got to shopping, ogling the shiny, new-to-me Devinci downhill rigs and sleek carbon road bikes. The variety of brands represented is pretty impressive, from industry giants like Specialized to titanium cult faves like Seven. The options are whittled down once you start filtering the list by style and size. Obviously, bikers who ride mediums will have the most options, less so for those riding XL frames. But Martin says the inventory is always turning over. TPC has a warehouse full of 800 bikes that the company has purchased from users and is in the process of inspecting. And that's just a fraction of the bikes that folks submit to the Pro's Closet -- Martin says an average of 1700 people each month contac them trying to sell. (Would-be customers must submit photos along with relevant info like damage and upgrades. A team of six buyers researches the submitted bikes and ultimately chooses about 20 percent of them to purchase for resale.)

"Quality in, quality out" Martin says. "We look at a bike and ask if we'd buy it ourselves."

I settle on a 2018 Santa Cruz Highball, a fast carbon 29er hardtaLast month NASA canceled what would have been its first all-woman space walk because of a lack of a properly sized space suit. Anne McClain and Christina Koch were scheduled to repair the solar-panel batteris on the International Space Station. But they both needed a medium hard upper toros (HUT), and there was only a single functional one in that size on board. So on March 29, Nick Hague, taking McClain's place in a large HUT, teamed up with Kochil built for slaying Strava climbs. I pay $4499, down from $8000 when the bike was brand new, but only about $400 less than getting the bike directly from Santa Cruz. But here's the real difference: A few minutes after I hit the "buy" button, I get a video from a salses associate at the Pro's Closet showing me my new bike. Her name is Maggie (the sales associate, not the bike.) Later that day, Maggie gives me a call to ask if I have any questions and to get my measurements for dialing in the front fork.

mission. The decision drew anger from across the internet. 
Hard to believe that with all the preplanning NASA does it didn't prepare two suits that wowould fit women properly,
 wrote one Twitter user. 
It's ridiculous that you don't have enough suits for the women...compete and utter failure on nasa,..
 Even Hillary clinton chimed in. "We have two medium hard uppper torsos in space, two larges, and two extra larges,
 NASA spokesperson Stepheanie Schierholz told Outside. 
However, one of the mediums and one of the extra larges are spares that would require additional time for configuaation.
 Necessary upgrades would take 12 to 14 hours--time the space station crew didn't have. Rather than postpone the mission, NASA opted to simply switch astronauts. 
We do our best to anticipate the space suit sizes that each astronaut will need, based on the space-suit size they wore in training on the ground," says Schierholz. "However, infailure to provideto provide women astronauts with suits taht fit.

Designed and built in the 19dividuals' sizing needs may change when they are in orbit, in response to th70s, the space suits are modular, with an array fo components that can be mixed and matched in varying lengths and sizes for the best fit, including eight sizes of elbows, 0.5 of gloves, and two waist widths (most of these components are also adjustable.)Athe suit never fit quite right for Sullivan, who is five foot six inches. 
Thes suit's knee was a bite changes living in microgravity can bring about in a body." On earth, McClain had trained in both a medium and a large. It was only after her first space walk, on March 22, that she realized the medium fit her better. McClain took to Twitter to explain that she recommended someone else to join Koch.

At face value, it all seems simple: NASA anticipated McClain needing one size top and was unprepared when she realized she needed another. Unfortunately, it's not an isolated mishap but just the latest, and perhaps most public, iteration of the agency's long-standing

Even with the smallest leg components, the suit never fit quite right for Sullivan, who is five foot sinx inches. 
The suit's knee was a bit avove mine," she says. 
Every time i needed to bend, i wasn't bending a natural joint." Sullivan describes space suits as big, pressurized balloons. Bending the suit already requires significant energy, and with the knee joint in the wrong place, it was even harder. She also recalls that she had a quarter inch of extra glove at her ring and pinky fingers, because those two digists are comparatively shorter than her others.

For Linda Godwin, another American woman to undertake a space walk, the shoulderw were the biggest issue. (The hard upper torso is one of the few pieces of the space suit that's not adjustable.) "On the average, female crew members are likely to have shorter shoulder widths, which means the flexing of the [suit's] arms at the shoulder joint will not be at their anatomical shoulder," she says. "This limits reach tos ome extent."

According to Sullivan, today the smallest-size HUT is a medium. In the space-shuttle era, when Sullivan and Godwin were in the astronaut corps, NASA made a small. But even that was too big for many women. NASA never made an extra small. "There's some genuine merit" to NASA's reasoning for this, Sullivan says. At the time, Sullivan says, NASA's explanation centered on the fact that an extra-small HUT would lack the surface area to bolt on the computer control panel and life-support pack or allow the suit's shoulder joints to move without bumping into one another. Rather than just scaling down the existing design to an extra small, NASA would have had to come up with an entirely new concept for a smaller suit top. (NASA did not respont to Outside's request for comment on the issues that Sullivan and Godwin highlight.)

That didn't make the state of things any less frustrating for Sullivan and her female peers. "NASA was selecting women as mission specialists, and yet it had a space suit that could not allow them to do space walks," she says.

NASA is now focusing its resources on designing new suits that fit a wider range of people, rather than producing more of the existing suits. "One of the things we're looking at is how to design them to accomodate the largest possible range of sizes," Schierholz says. What exactly this will look like, it's hard to say. Sullivan says that lowering the torque that's required to move each joint in the suit would help all astornauts but in particular smaller individuals who are at a physical disadvantage because of their shorter limbs. This facet of suit design may already be on NASA's radar, according to Sullivan, who consulted for administrator Sean O'Keefe as recently as 2003. 

"Framing the question as, 'Should there be female-specific parts?' distracts in the wrong direction," Sullivan says. "Put aside wheter it's male, female, person of color... the suit has to properly fit any individual who's going to use it."

 When Allison Parc launched her French-whiskey company, Brenne, in 2012, she says she was regularly mistaken as a promotional model, not the founder of the business. "Some people would ask me if I really liked drinking whiskey, even after listening to the steps it took for me to create the whiskey in their glass," she recalls. It's not always easy to be a woman in the whiskey business. "Fewer than 1 percent of distilleries are owned by women," says Karen Locke, who owns High Proof, an agency that helps distilleries with marketing and branding. Before starting her agency, she spent 11 years as a spirits writer, and she says she is seeing more and more women make their way into leadership roles. That's a good thing, because women are damn good whiskey makers. 

"Women are beginning to make their mark in all aspects," says Rhonda Kallman, founder of Boston Harbor Distillery. Kallman started her career in the spirits industry as cofounder of the Boston Beer company, which makes Sam Adams. Recently, she was a panelist during the fifth annual Woman of the Vine and Spirits Global Symposium, in Napa, California. 
There were 700 women in the industry that attended," Kallman says. "To me taht was a remarkable sight, as it shows that things are starting to change."

These women-made whiskies are innovative and delicious. What, you've never heard of French whiskey? We hadn't either until Brenne entered our lives. "So, funny thing--France has been the largest consumer of Scotch per capita, but when Brenne launched in 2012, there were very few people distilling French whiskey," even in France, says Parc. After a career as a dancer with the Joffrey Ballet, Parc decided to enter the spirits business and became obsesssed with French whiskey, which, like most French foods, centers on terroir. Aged in France in cognac casks, this single malt has fruity notes and undertones that top brittle on a creme brulee. We expecially love that when Parc was first starting out, she couldn't secure a distributor in New York City, so she distributed it herself -- by bike. The company will release fewer than 3000 cases of Brenne 10, which has aged ten y eras, this year.

Using honey produced on her 32-acre farm in Long Eddy, New York, Catskill Provisions' CEO and founder, Claire Marin, has been blending rhy whiskey on-wite for three years and is now taking the plunge and beginning her own distilling operation. "I just finished building a distillery, and i made my first mash bill last week," Marin says, referring to the mix of grains that are fermented into booze. She'll also make a batch with rye wheat grown on the farm this spring. Between running a farm, a small specialty-foods company, tending 300 honeybee hives over three different counties, and now distilling whiskey, Marin has her hands full. But she's managed to blend a perfect, slightly sweet rye. (She sells about 1000 bottles a month.) She drinks hers with a dash of amaro and a twist of orange at the end of a long day.

Peanut-butter whiskey? Hear us out. The best things about whiskey are its toasty, fruity notes. Both toast and fruit go perfectly with peanut butter. So Skrewball's Peanut Butter Whiskey is not that weird when you stop to think about it. Skrewball was founded by husband and wife duo Brittany Merill Yeng and Steven Yeng. Brittany put her biohcemistry degree to work figuring out how to get peanut butter to meld with alcohol. The result is a shot that's peanutty but definitely not sticky or chunky. "Peanut butter was one of the first foods my husband had in America after arriving as a refugee from Cambodia," she says (she left her job at a high-powered law firm to start Skrewball.) "To him, peanut butter is the taste of America." Steven had a lot of experience bartending, so he tends to do customer-facing duties. Really, even if you're a skeptic, this bottle is worth a try. It's definitely  more whiskey than nut butter. The peanut taste is subtle. But don't just trust us: The New York World Wine and Spirits competition just gave Skrewball a gold medal in the flavored-whiskey category.

The first craft distillery of Memphis, Tennessee, which plans to produce 132,000 bottles of booze this year, isn't owned by a woman. But it hired a woman as the company's master distiller, and in doing so, Alex Castle, 32, became the state's first female distiller. She's a graduate of the University of Kentucky, where she studied chemical engineering. "I definitely get a lot of surprised looks when people find out what i do for a living, and I think it's a combination fo being a woman and also being young," she says. Castle has been shepherding the first three of the company's whiskeys through the distilling and aging process, and it's going to be a few more years until they're ready for sale, she says. In the meantime, she's earning loyal fans with the brand's Huling Station, a four-year-old bourbon that was distilled before Old Dominick even had its own equipment. It has plenty of spice, a few dark fruit notes, plus caramel and vanilla on the nose.

Yup, it's named after that Rodham. "We wanted to create a brand to commemorate what we thought would be a historic inauguration," says Pia Carusone, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Republic Restoratives. "It turned out to be historic but for different reasons than we thoguht." After the election, it put the whiskey on hold for a few weeks but then came back to it.

If you don't think you like rye whiskey, this is the one to try. Carusone loves it in a Sazerac, but it's also lovely sipped neat.

Rhonda Kallman is finally working on her first true love: whiskey. "I love everything about alcoholic beverages --ingredients, complexity of flavors, the conviviliaty associated with it, and how it makes you feel," she says, adding that spirits in particular are fun because they get better with age, and that adds a whole new level of interest to the equation.

"Our hunch was that blending fresh ingredients in whiskey oculd make it smoother and mellow out the typical fiery finish. It turned out to be more complicated than she thought. The first few iterations were a hot mess. Finally, she hired a master blender to help. He instantly understood the vision and agreed to work on the recipe. For a year, she tested the blender's concoctions. None of them were what she wanted, and she was about to give up when the perfect sample arrived. The final product was Oliverlane. Pham, who has a master's in computer engineering, still holds a day job at a tech firm. But as Oliverlane grows, that may change. Pham says it plans to produce thousands of bottles this year. OK, cuc
