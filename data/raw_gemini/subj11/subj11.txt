viral infection commonly lead to significcant morbidity and mortality. A third of death from all infectious disease worldwide are of viral origin. While the most effective means to combat such infection are vaccinations, treatment and prevention measure can often be achieved with medicines. However a number of therapeutic challenges hamper the development of effective antiviral therapy such as the limited spectrum of most antivirals and inherent drug toxicity. A notable step forward is reported in the current issues of Nature material. Francesco Stellacci and collegues describe braod spectrum antiviral employing nano particle formulated mimics of heparan sulphate proteoglycan. Antiviral medicine have been designed to block specific stages of viral life cycle by viral receptor binding, penetration, uncoating, nucleic acid chain elongation, transcription, translation and assembly and release. Any or all attempts to use such regime to eliminate viral infections have encounterd drawback due to viral mutations and virus heterogencity. These lead to microbial sequestering and consequent escape from immune surveillance independent of latent infections. Limitations in delivery and maintaenance of inhibitory antiviral drug concentration at viral grwth site have also slowed pharmacologics sucess. Such restricted activites in antiviral drug have highlighted recent research activities for human immun-defivciency virus and Ebola virus prophylaxis, treatment and vaccine preventive measures. Improving the balance between the antiviral and host cell homeostatsis underlies any drug therapeutic index. The search for non-toxic and broadly active agents that inhibits a range of viral infections remain urgent. While interferons and ribavirin are used to fill this niche, both commonly cause flu-like symptoms, chest pain and diarrhoea while demostrating limited antiviral activities. A mean of improving antiviral agents is to repurpose already approved drugs .Nanomaterials have been widely utilized for drug delivery in a number of applications. They can also be employed in the delivery of antiviral agents to sites of viral replications by using the cells as depots. Macrophages carriages as vehicles for drug dessiminations in viral reservoirs can be achieved using this approaches. Antiviral nanoparticles hide within endosomal depots that enableas longterm cell based drug storage. tability is realized and ensured through the cells own Rab GTPases serving to coordinate particle drug trafficking, vesicles formation, movement, fusion and release. Drug particles that are retained in Rab endosomal depots are delivered to tissues infected with viruses by mobile cell. This nanoparticle based stratergy may also be employed in the delivery system agent to sites of viral replication by using cells as depots. Macrophages carriages as vehicles for drug dessimination in the viral reservoiurs can be achieved using this approach. This nanoparticle based stratergy may also be deplyoed to target a spectrum of intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It may also be employed in antiviral gene therapies utilizing CRIS[Hongkong scientist claim they have made a potential breakthrough discovery in the fight against infectious disease- a chemical that could slow the spread of deadly viral illness. A team from University of Hong Kong described the newly discovered chemicals as highly potent in interrupting the life cycle of diverse viruses in a study published this month in the journal Nature Communications. Scientist told AFP Monday that it could one day be used as a broad-spectrum antiviral for a host of infectious disease and even for viruses that have yet to emerge-if it passes clinical trials. The spread in recent decades of sometime deadly bird flu strain, the middle east respiratory syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome have underscord the need for new drug that can work more quickly than vaccines. Broad spectrum antivirals are seen as the holy grail because they can be used against multiple pathogens. In contrast, vaccine usually only protect  aganist one strain and by the time vaccine is produced the virus may have been mutated. The HKU team tested their chemical "AM580" on mice in a two year study and found it stopped the replication of a host of flu strains-including H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9- as well as the viruses that cause SARS and MERS. It also stopped the replication of the mosquito-borne Zika virus and Enterovirus 71 which causes hand, foot and mouth disease. This is what we call a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, which means it can kill a number of viruses" , microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung, who led the lead, told FP. This is quite important in the early control of an epidemic. The study is part of a growing body of research by virologist to find drugs that avoid targeting the virus directly-something which could lead to resistance. Instead they look for compounds that interrupt the way viruses use crucial fatty acid, known as lipids, within a host cells to replicate. This study is science in progress- an early step in an exciting new direction" said Benjamin Neuman, an expert on viruses at Texas A&M Iniversity- Texarkana who has published his own studies on starving viruses on lipids. "Viruse are totally dependent on supplies stolen from their host and number of recent studies have shown that treatment that interuption of the steady flow of lipids in an infected calls are highly efective at blocking a wide range of viruses", he told FP. The next step is to test the drug on wider variety of animals, including pigs and primates, before pushing to clinical trials, a process Yeun said could take upto eight years. The HKU team have applied for a patent in the United States. A derivative of AM580 is already being used in Japan to treat cancer, raising hopes that it will show low toxicity for humans. But Neuman warns there are drawbacks. Like many chemotherapy methods used to fight cancer, antiviral such as AM580 damage a  persons cell to starve a virus. While cell can heal, much research still needs to be done on how and when to use such techniques. "Unless the treatment is targeted very carefully, the potential for side effect would be very worrying' he said. Densely populated Hong Kong has first hand experience of deadly viral outbreaks. In 2003 nearly 300 people died from SARS nad the city's densely packed apartments bloacks are considered hugely vulnerable to future outbreaks. ARTHROPODS-BORN FLAVIVIRUS INCLUDES  HUMAN PATHOGENS OF GLOBAL Arthropods borne flaviruses include human pathogens of global medical importance such as dengue virus (DenV), Yellow fever Virus (YFV), Nile virus (WNV) Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) Zika virus. These viruses are causative of many serious disease with a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms rNGING FROM MILD FLU LIKE SYMPTOM THROUGH NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE. Upto 200 million new cases of infection caused by arthropods borne flaviviruses are reported annually. These viruses can be widespread as exemplified by the epidemiological outbreaks of WNV infection across North America, Mexico, South America, and Caribbeans during 1999- 2002. At present, there is no effective antiviral therapyu directed against these viruses and therefore, search for small molecule based inhibitors represent an unmet medical needs. ARBIDOL, ALSO KNOWN AS UMIFENOVIR, is a broad spectrum antiviral compound developed at the Russian Research Chemical about 25 years ago and licenced in Russia and Chinna for the prophylaxis and treatment of Influenza   A & B infection plus post influenza complications. Subsequently arbidol was shown to be active agaist numerous DNA and RNA, enveloped and non enveloped viruses. The predominant mode of action of arbidol is based  on its intercalation into membrane lipids leading to the inhibition of  of membrane fusion  between virus particles and plasma membrane and between virus particles and membranes of endosomes. In influenza viruse, arbidol was observed to interact with virus haemagluttinin causing of an increase in Hastability thereby preventing the pH induced transition of HA into its functional fusogenic state. In the case of Hepatitis C virus arbidol interacts with HCV enveloped protein to cause variuos degrees of inhibition of critical membrane fusion event. Alternatively, arbidole may also be immunomodulatory and such be capable of interferon induction and or macrophage activation. Due to such broad spectrum antiviral activities, arbidol represents a promising candidate for treatment of viral infections in human . Accordingly, we describe here using standardized in vitro system the cytotoxicities and antiviral activities of arbidol aagainst three representative flavivirus. Since antiviral compounds are extensively inactivated/metabolized in the intracellular environment, different cell lines were utilized to assess simultaneously both the antiviral and the corresponding cytotoxic effect of arbidol. Arbidol was obtained from Sigma aldrich solubilized in DMSO to yield 10 nM stock solution The following viral starins/isolates were used in this study. The compound cytotoxicity was determined in terms of cell viability using cell counting Kit-8 according to the manufacture instruction and expressed as the 50% cytotoxic concentration of compound that reduced cell viability by 50%. A viral titre reduction assay was performed to determine the flavivirus sensitivity to arbidolin cell culture. Host cells were seede in 96 well plates and incubated for 24 hours at 37 to form a confluent monolayer. The medium was then aspirated from the wells and repalced with fresh medium containg the medium arbidol and appropriate viral strain were introduced. Then the supernatant were transferred in viral titre and determination was done by plaque assay and used for construction of dose response inhibition curves and for estimation of the 50% effective concentration. Supernatant media were collected every six hours until 48 hours. Arbidol has shown some significant in-vitro efficacy when tested against two starins as with Zika. In Vero cells, arbidol administration were found to inhibit viral replication in all cases. In fact a rapid reduction of viral titre was observed within the firat 6 hours then the titre remain low even below detection until the end of experiments. Our data agrees with the numerous reports of the in-vitro arbidol mediated inhibition of other viruses of medical interest. Arbidol inhibits replication of various sub-types of human influenza A and B viruses with EC50 values. Arbidol is also known to inhibit Chikungunya virus replication in vero cells  or in primary human fibroblast. According to WHO, there is an urgent need for better control of viral disease. Re-positioning existing safe-in-human antiviral agents from one viral disease to other could play a pivotel role in this process. Here, we reviewed all approved, investigational and experimental antiviral agents, which are safe for man, and identified 59 compounds that target atleast three viral diseases. We tested 55 of these compounds against eight different RNA and DNA viruses. We found novel activities for dalbavancin against echovirus 1, ezetimibe against HIV-1 and Zika virus. Thus, the spectrum of antiviral activities of existing antiviral agents could be expanded towards other viral diseases. Dozens of viruses, such as FLUV, HSV-1, VZV, CMV and NoV, constantly infect human population and represent sustantial public health and economic burden. Emerging and re-emerging viruses such as EBOV, MARV, LASV, CHIKV, DENV, RVFV and SARS surface from natural reserviours approximately one each year and also represent the global threat. According to WHO, there is an urgent need for better control of these viruses, including drug resistant and vaccine immunity escapting viral strains. Antiviral drugs and vaccine are the most powerful tools to combact viral disease. Most drug and vaccines, however, selectively target a single virus, thereby providing a "one drug-one bug" solution. By contrast broad spectrum antivirals can cover multiple viruses and genotype and reduce the liklihood of development of resistance. Therefore, some BSAs can be used for rapid managment of new or drug-resistant viral strains, for treatment of viral co-infections reducing therapy complexity, as well as a first line treatment or the prophylaxis of acute virus infections. Thus, to overcome time and cost issues associated with the development of virus-specific drugs and vccines, the development of BSAs should be prioritized. Nucleotide and nucleoside analogues are excellent examples of BSAs. They inhibit transcription and/or replication of different RNA and DNA viruses. In particular, valaciclovir inhibits replication of different herpes virus and HBV. Cidofovir and its lipid conjugate brinvidovir also inhibit replication of dsDNA viruse such as herpesviruses. Favipiravir also inhibits replication of different RNA viruses. However, viruses are able to develop resistance to some of these nucleotide and nucleoside analogues. Other examples of BSA agent includes inhibitors of cellular pathway, which are exploited by different viruses for efficient viral replication. These agents overcome the problem of antiviral drug resistance. For example, lipid lowering statin inhibit cellualr HMG-CoA reductase and attenuate replication of some enveloped viruses.
