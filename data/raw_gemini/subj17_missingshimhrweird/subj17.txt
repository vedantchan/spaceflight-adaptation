In March-April 2019, widespread flash flooding affected large areas of Iran, most severely in Golestan, Fars, Khuzestan, Lorestan, and other provinces. At least 62 people died nationwide as of 3 April. Twenty-three of the nation's thirty-one provinces experienced flooding. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies launched major relief efforts with the Iranian Red Crescent deploying 11,000 personnel. On 20 March 2019, massive rainfall in the two provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran in Iran brought about heavy flooding. These floods resulted in the financial damage to the people living in these areas and the death of two children. Parts of Golestan province received 50-70 percent of their average yearly rainfall over a five-day period. Some areas recorded approximately 300 mm (12 in) of rainfall, equivalent to the usual annual rainfall. These amounts exceed the past rainfall in the region for at least 70 years. The floods in Golestan and Mazandaran provinces is considered a 1-in-100 year event. On 25 March, flash floods following heavy rains in Southwestern Iran in the vicinity of the city of Shiraz killed 19 people and injured more than 200 others. Many people were traveling for the Nowruz holiday, and were injured or killed when their cars were swept off of roads. Rain was short but heavy, lasting in two bursts of approximately 15 minutes each, however, the impact was exacerbated by the heavy road traffic at the time. Iran's Meteorological Organisation gave warnings for further floors, as heavy rains were expected to last at least until 27 March. The leader of the Iranian Ministry of Energy has stated that climate change was a contributing factor to the flooding. As of 26 March 2019, 20 of Iran's 31 Provinces are either currently flooded or facing the possibility of imminent flooding. A brief but intense rainfall caused a sudden flash flood that submerged a main highway between Shiraz and Esfahan, trapping many travelers who had been leaving the city after Nowruz celebrations. City officials did not warn the people of Shiraz of the deadly weather conditions resulting in many deaths. Heavy rains of 3 April, have completely overwhelmed several towns in the mountainous Lorestan province. The town of Poldokhtar in Lorestan Province was engulfed by flood water. After the floodwaters subsided, cars and homes remained sunken in thick layers of mud. According to an internal police report, at least 90 people were killed when floods engulfed the western city of Podokhtar in Lorestan province. According to the IRGC-affiliated Tasnim News Agency, Heydari said that the conditions in Poldokhtar were "horrific". The flooding caused the destruction of hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure and collapse of at least 314 bridges across the country. Twenty-three of the nation's thirty-one provinces were affected. Agriculture suffered tremendous damage, with losses in the sector reaching 46 trillion rials (US$1.1 billion) by 3 April. Golestan accounted for the largest portion at 20 trillion rials (US$480 million). At least 25,00 houses were completely destroyed, while another 60,000 sustained some form of damage. Mohamad Hossein Talebian, deputy chairman of Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization reported on 27 March that "cracks on the ancient reliefs in Naqsh-e Rustam in Fars province are widening in a critical way." Social media reports revealed a waterfall made by the floods that has been washing away parts of the monument. In April 1398, the floors caused severe damage to the city of Khorramabad. The construction of a new and non-expert bridge on the Khorramabad River with a very low altitude from the river level has exacerbated and flooded the streets of Khorramabad city. Although, according to Talebian, "The Persepolis remains intact as its ancient water ducts have drained flood water." The ancient water ducts also protected the Tomb of Cyrus the Great and saved the internationally acclaimed sity from destruction by the floods. Excavations of Great Wall of Gorgan were also damaged due to its close proximity to a dry riverbed which experienced flooding. The floods have damaged the Aq Qala bridge in northern Iran and several other centuries-old bridges in Isfahan and Shoushtar. The Government of Iran declared a state of emergency for Khuzestan Province on 31 March. President Hassan Rouhani deployed "all available capacities" to assist victims. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) launched widespread relief efforts nationwide. Sayed Hashem, the IFRC's Middle East regional director, called the floods "an unprecedented crisis". The Iranian Red Crescent led recovery efforts, deploying 11,000 personnel to assist 192,000 people. The Turkish Red Crescent deployed a five-truck convoy carrying 320 tents, 500 bedstead, 100 hygiene kits, 1,625 blankets, 360 kitchen kits and 60 stoves. By 3 April, the agency released 500,000 francs from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to assist 3,000 families. Through 1 April, Iranian citizens donated more than 15 billion rials (US$3.7 million) to the Iranian Red Crescent. Shortly after the floods began the Rouhani administration proceeded to ban all third-party charities to help the flood relief effort citing that all donations must be made directly to the Iranian government thus preventing foreign aid from reaching the country. The governor of Golestan province was also reportedly on vacation outside the country during the floods. Authorities also banned foreign journalists from covering the flood stricken areas. Rouhani and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei were heavily criticized for their delayed response. Rouhani was on vacation on Iran's Qeshm Island in the Persian Gulf and returned to Tehran while the floods had begun subsiding. The lack of aid and absence of the Iranian government quickly prompted outrage among the victims of the floods. Iranians across the nation expressed their frustration by a Persian hashtag translated as "Where is Rouhani?" Iranians also began calling for Rouhani's resignation. Many Iranians took to social media platforms to criticize the handling of the floods by the government, specifically Rouhani, while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Khamenei were also the targets of criticism. Swedish-Iranian academic and researcher Ahmad Reza Jalali, currently on death row after being sentenced at the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran, gave an interview to U.S. government-funded Radio Farda attributing the destruction of natural plant coverage, obstruction of flood outlets, and converting flood roues and dry river beds to residential areas following the Islamic Revolution were the causes of the flash floods in Shiraz. Germany: On Monday, April 1, Germany's ambassador to Iran, Michael Klor-Berchtold, announced on his Twitter account that the German foreign ministry would provide humanitarian assistance to Iran, namely that 40 boats and safety equipment would be delivered by the German Red Cross to the Iranian Red Crescent. United States: Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, tweeted that "These floods once again show the level the Iranian regime mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness." Pompeo also stated that he offered condolences and made an offer of aid, but no additional details were provided. Turkey: The Turkish Red Crescent deployed a five-truck convoy carrying 320 tents, 500 bedsteads, 100 hygene kits, 1,625 blankets, 360 kitchen kits and 60 stoves.

The title Secretary of State or State secretary is commonly used for senior or mid-level posts in governments around the world. The role varies between countries, and in some cases there are multiple secretaries of state in the government. In many countries, a secretary of state is a mid-level post. It is usually a politically appointed position, although in some countries, such as Germany and Sweden, it can be filled by a member of the executive bureaucracy (civil service) as a political appointment.
