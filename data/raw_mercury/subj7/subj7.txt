Ana Suda and Mimi Hernandez, who live in Montana, say they were at the Town Pump convenience store in Havre, Montana, when a border patrol officer demanded to see identification.

They allege in the lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on Thursday, that the agent "singled them out based on race, relying on their use of Spanish as a justification and proxy for race."
