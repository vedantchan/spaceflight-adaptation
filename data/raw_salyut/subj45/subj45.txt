by how it works team 07/02/2012

Italian Paolo Nespoli, 54, has spent 174 days in space across two missions, travelling into Earth orbit on both NASA's Space Shuttle and the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. We asked what it's like to live in space, how it felt to witness the Space Shuttle docked to the ISS and more in our exclusive interview.

How It Works: Why did you decide to become an astronaut?

Paolo Nespoli: Ever since I was a littel boy I wanted to become an astronaut. I was inspired by the Apollo missions, though not really Apollo 11. I was more interested in the later missions where they drove the rovers on teh moon. I thought it was fascinating, with the astronauts jumping and riving around on the surface. Life was kind of different after that. I was drafted into the Italian army (they still had the draft back then) then figured out taht I could make it as an astronaut. I applied twice to the European Space Agency (ESA) and didn't make it, but on the third section I made the cut. 

HIW: Your first mission to space was on board STS-120. What was it like going to space for the first time?

PN: I was slected fairly young and got to fly after just nine years of training, which is somewhat of a short time to wait compared to many. People asked if I was scared but I wasn't really. I'd trained os much, I knew what to expect. Feeling the acceleration in the Space Shuttle was amazing. The first couple of minutes, it really shakes you. However, I was scared in space, because we'd trained for years and we only had 15 days to complete our mission. All I kept thinking to myself was, 'You better not mess this up. People have been working on this for years!' The fear of failure was the scariest thing about going to space. 

HIW: What was the hardest part of going to space?

PN: I didn't mind it so much in space, but myb ody felt really old when I came back to EArth; the gravity was so intense. I was fine in space but I'm not exceptional or a superhero. Of the seven Shuttle crew memebers and three on the Soyuz I was the worst coming back by far. The micro-gravity environment does a lot to your body. You lose a lot of calcium in space, your bones and muscles can get weak. 

HIW: How did you ensure yoru body stayed in shape? How did you adapt to life in space?

PN: We'd do about two hours of physical fitness every day. I would say you come back inb etter shape [in terms of fitness] Doing two hours of exxercise every day for six months, I came back with more muscles and less fat then when I left. We did about an hour of cardiovascular exercise on a treadmill and another hour of resistance exercise. Obviously, you can't lift weights in space, so a machine simulates the strain of lifting as on Earth. 

There's no training to prepare your body for its loss of balance. You get nausea and all sorts of things. Your skeleton also stretches (I was five or six centimeters taller than on earth) and so muscles keep their strength but they are of a different length. Your body's equililbrium sifts, and when you coem back to Earth the msucles start contracting again, but they cannot find the equilibrium point so easily. I remember shaking constantly. Also I could be sitting and feeel totally tired. Coming back ot Earth is definitely the hardest aspect of being in space - for me anyway! 

On the station, you are isolated and confined, with only a few other people to talk to. You can't just go out in the evening and see people. For some reason I discovered that wahtever I was doing I was seeing pizzas all over the place, such as in clouds when looking at Earth. Freud would probably have a lot to say aobut that! I thought the food on teh station was decent but far way from what an Italian would say is delicious. It was very good from a nutritional point of view, but a little horrific for an Italian. Maybe I was craving pizza becasue of food like that, or maybe it was just associating pizza with going out with friends and having a beer, maybe that is what I was missing. You are in isolatino up there, and there are a lot of things you can't do, a lot of things which aren't normal. 

Sometimes you forget that you're in space. It takes about a month and a half before you get out of your 'Earth Habits', betting used to space, doing things in a different way. For example, we had a table in one of the nodes for eating in the evening. That table had been there for years. It was horizontal in respect to the floor of the deck, because that's how a talbe is on Earth. It was protruding a lot, and you'd often hit it when going past. One day I was looking at it and I thoguht, there must be ab etter way do do this. Why is the table parallel to the deck, when there's no gravity? You use Velcro to stick things to the table anyway so that they don't float away, so why not have it at an angle, like a technical drawing table? I kind of tilited it up a little bit then more and more until finally if you look at it now, it's tilted at asteep angle because you don't need a horizontal table and it's much more out of the way. It was there for ten years before somebody thought to move it! 

I would say that it is an environment that is closed, isolated and conined. At first when I was told I would psend six months on teh station before the mission I thought Oh my God, six months are you out of your mind? Looking back I realized that I didn to have the time to do everythign I wanted like taking more pictures, looking at Earth, playing around more, calling people, doing video clips. You end up doing things up there tha tmake sense. Time flies and everythign is nice but you wish you could have done more. 

HIW: What was your favorite aspect of living in space?

PN: I loved taking pictures, looking at hte Earth and [re]discovering it. It was very enoyable. You just go to the window and there you have it- a great nd gorgeous view. However, when you go to the window randomly, more often than not you're just going to see an ocean with clouds. It's nice and blue, but that's about it. Sometimes you see a piece of land going by and it's not so recognizable. It's not easy to figure out what's what, except Italy! When yo ustart talking about ht eUK and Ireland it gets complicated because of the angle, cloud coverage, time of day and sun reflection etc. In the beginning you try to figure out where you are without using the software that ells us but little by little you start to know what's going on. By the second/ third/fourth months you look out the window and you know where you are- the continent, informatin, featuers that are there that you micht want to take pictures of, or if it's boring you might spend a few minutes on something else. 

I started using more and more powerful lenses to capture some interesting details that I could see from up there. First I tried to see the Egyptioan pyramids, the Great Wall of China, and other landwmarks. I wanted to see an aircraft carrier at sea, some volcanoes, special islands and then I started looking around randomly, taking pictures of things that were astonishing and different. I had this feeling that I was a scientist peering down a microscope that allowed me to take pictures of this small sphere rotating below, discovering microscopic things. I'd look at the pictures and realize that those thign were 20 kilometers in diameter. You can't really see things tha are any smaller than that. 

I became really interested in taking photos of landmarks and countries. I started using social media like Twitter and Flickr because I thoguth those things were interesting. I decided to start tweeting them to see what people thought. That turne dout to be ab pertty good souce of enjoyment, finding something special and tweeting it to people, asking them for quizzes or riddles from space and seeing all the comments. It turne dout to be a very enjoyable way to spend time, letting everybody participate in this adventure. 

HIW: Were you asked to take pictures by NASA or ESA?

PN: I wasn't asked to do it by NASA or the ESA. Some of the other astronauts had done it before me. I was not the first, several of them told me that it was enjoyable. I did not tweet before I went into space because I don't have much time to do it. I see some people go around with phones all day, typing what they are doing, clicking, clicking, clicking but I have so many thigns to do. However, in space it worked out pretty well. Sometimes when I was taking pictures I was asking for help from ESA to identify what aI was looking at. Other times I would guess but sometimes I would make a mistake and people would correct me so I learned that itwas better to verify waht I was seeing before hafl ot the world things 'What is that supid astronaut doing up there?!" One of the first weeks I was up I tweeted ap icture ofa European city and really thought it was London..Turns out it was Pars. How can you make a mistake between London and Paris? It was byeond me. Butin space, you travel so fast that you pass by so quickly and you only have a few seconds to snap a picture. You haven o time to resarch so mistakes do happen. 

HIW: Did it feel like you were travelling at 17,000mph?

PN: Well, it dpeends. If you are above an ocean for example which happened often, it doesn't look like you are oging very fast. But if you want to take a picture of something specific, then you understand how precise you need to be. I'm always on space time now. When I'm at home in the vening and I look outside and see a sunset or moon. I see a nice picture and think Okay I'm going to get my camera and I'll take a picture in 30 minutes. Ins pace if you see the moon and you like it, you better take that picture in the next 10 seconds brecause it's gone. A good sunset is eight seconds and you think Oh that's a nice sunset I'll just get my camera... Holy cow, I need a picture now where's that camera! If you take out the card or wrong lens, then it's gone. [This is how I mainly percieved speed on the ISS]

You don't feel anything phiscally on the ISS or the Soyuz capsule though. I remember when we detatched from the station on Soyuz comign back to Earth, ther eis a moment in which the engine fires and you slow down and go into the atomsphere, and the capsule breask up into three pieces. You are in the middle, the only one that gets to Earth, the others burn up in the atmosphere. At that point you are tumbling, finishing with a braking burn. The capsule has seperated and you are waiting to be captured by the atmosphere. Then you look outside and realize you're tumbling. It's not a nice feeling. Are we supposed to be tumbling, you think. If you don't look outside you don't feel it, even at Mach 25.

HIW: What were you rmain roles on the ISS?

PN: I was one of the light engineers for the space statino. We do a lot of things up there. The main purpose is to take advantage of the micro-gravity environment and the position of the ISS for all sorts of experiemnets. Most of them you cannot do on ground because of the presence of gravity. I would say that 30-40 per cent of the time was passed carrying out scientific experiments in many fields. I did some in life science, for example how my brain adapts to the micro gravity environment, and all sorts of tests on computers and other stuff. The reason for the work on my brain was because you go into space you actually enter a new environment and the brain has to adapt to the new situation. It's very similar to someone on the Earth who has an accidenta nd lsoes a part of the brain or a limb and needs tore-learn to doa ll these things. 

In space suddenly there is no more gravity and you can't just walk you have to push yourself you have to do things in a new way. You have to invent a way to do it by looking at how the brain adapts. Doing this enables scientists to figure out that can be useful on teh ground. For exmaple, I was a guinea pig for osteoporisis. They gave mea  special diet for weeks, one week at a time. They were changing myd iet, from having lots of proteins and othe ones lots of vegetable proteins and antoehr one I tried was having ltos ofpotassium which is thought to inteffere with tehh osteoprosis mechanism. They do all these things, they look at you and check your body parameters figuring out if there are any relatively simple solutions like does food affect how people lose bone mass?

About 50 percent of my time was spent maintaing the station. It's amazing how work intensive it is to maintain a laboratory like this. You have supply ships arriving every month. It's like you lived in your hosue and never left, but once a month a truckw ould come to your front door and dock there. Everything you'd need for that month would be in that truck. The air you breathe the water you rink, all the supplies, all the equipment, all the spare parts, pieces of tubes for plumbin, electricty, a new TV, a new computer, a new telephone, I really mean everything. And then you have to take everything from this truck and put somewhere you can find it again. You cannot just pile it up in space, because it floats away. After it's unpacked yout ake all your waste verythign you don't need and shove it in teh suply vehicle so that it gets thrown outa nd bursn up in teh atmosphere. That's a lot of work. Apart from the supply ship you need to cook, clean filters and put together faciliteis so that you can carry out experiemnts. A lot of things go into basic running of the space station. 

The last ten per ecent or so of my time was for physical fitness and educational or PR activites, such as talking to schools on teh phone. My expedition actually had the record for schools contact - 77- which meant thousands of kids were talkingt o us. You do a little video cipl for this and that, or you do an interview, let's call it outreach activit. Then in the vening, there is about an hour and a half for planned pre sleep activites, then you have eight hours of lseep, and after that you are one and a half hours of post sleep. In pre sleep you take care of yourself, do recreational things, clean up , eat this kind of thing. In the morning you're supposed dto have breakfst, a shower, the usual things. What I would usally do woudl be to compress activites. I would not sleep eight hours, instead of sleep about six, which left me three or four hours free in the evening. Then I could take more pictures, eat, sort out my photos, put them up on Twitter and Flickr, or call some friends. On the space station we have a phone, and often write emails. 

HIW: Can you call whenever you want?

PN: You can pretty much call when you want. It's a special phone-  though looks similair to that you'd find on any desk. It works throught a satellite system adn since you are rotating pretty fast you tend to losethe connection quickly and sometimes there are holes for 10-20 minutes. You can't use the phone continually. In general, if I want to call somebody that evening one way or the otehr I manage to call them in the evenings I mostly talked to my wife and daughter. 

HIW: How did you shave on ISS?

PN: This os one of the things you need to learn to do differently. Obviously you cannot always take a shower, as there's not muchw ater and it goesa ll over the place. Shaving you need to learn to do things in a whole new way. Fist I put a bit of water on my face, then take a pea size amount of shaving cream and just make it stick there on my face. Next I take a fresh razor blade and get shaving. There's no way you can actually clean the razor blade, so you just try to make it work forthe whole face, and then trow it away. There's nothing esleyou can do. Then you use a wet towel to rinse your face and that's it. 

HIW: How do yous tay celan on the ISS?

PN: The psace station is now in its complete assembly stage. All the planned modules ar eup there. For years they camped on the station but now we have what we call cre quarters. These are telphone booth sized spaces that have your sleeping bag, computer, personal stuff on the wall and cahnges of close etc. You can close the door and it's pretty private and dark. Your turn the lights off and you're isolated and insulated you can't hear people outside. For a personal space it's quite convenient. You try to use it on the ground and oh my god you never think you'll be able to sleep there because it's vertical and narrow. In zer gravity though it becomes very comofrtable. We do have a facility which techincally is called the Waste Hygiene Compartment. It's another telephone booth sized place that can be closed. Inside is your toilet and you can take your lcothes off and wash in a bitm ore comfort. We usually do wash ourselves ina piecemal fashion here and there or just use a towel. If you want to take a shower you go into this booth. We like to use this Russian towel, whichi svery thin and impregnated with soapy disinfectant liquied and you wrap this towel over your body. It's pretty ncie and you feel pretty clean when you do this. For washing your hair we have some rinseless hampoo, you put three or four teaspoons of water in your hair and wrap it through and then dry it up with a towel and that's it. 

We don't wash clothes up there you just tend to sort of use the same clothes over and over. They don't get dirty because it's so clean up there. On earth you go out and youll ge tdust or grease all over htem, but in space only bits of food might get on them. They don't particuarly smell bad until a few months of use. In six months I used only three pairs of trousers and I started with only four shirts. When they told me that's all I'd get for six months I couldn't believe it but it was fine. When you do phsyical fitness you use a special shirt to collect sweat. You use it and then hang it to dry somewhere . We use this same shirt fora  month and it's fine. 

ON the staiton it'sall pretyt clean, but somtiems there's a smell and we cannot open a window to get some fresh air. Instead the air is cahnged by the turnover systems and it's continuously circulated, filtered and cleaned the humidity is removed and some of the toxic thins are reomved It's pretty clena. There were cases that the carbon dioxide equipment was purposefully kept at a low rate, and then you feel a littel bit of space dust, but normally we feel very clean. 

HIW: What was it like being hte only perosn in history to see the Space Shuttle attached to the ISS?

PN: Well, you know I never thought wow I'm the only person to see this with my own eyes I'm othe only one that pictuers that willb ein the history books. If I thought all this i would get scared so I didn't. The maneuver to take pictures was not an easy one. It had some risks and there had been discussions forever between NASA and the Russians about this, because they were supposed to dit on the previous Shuttle mission but it was voted down the Russians didn't let them becasue of the risks. 

I was really concerend when I unstrapped form my seat and flew over the commander, who was manually piloting. There's not much space in the Soyuz so everyone was worried I would knock some of the controls and send the Soyuz spinning out of the sky. Then we had to open the hatch, which was already secured also something that is usally a big no. If you have closed and sealed it you don't want to go and berak the seal but we had to. Eventually I'm up there I'm looking outside and seeing this magnificent veiw adn it was astonishing. I found myself staring at it for 15 seconds adn then I had to snap myself out ofit. You are here to take pictures I thoguht. You better take some or you will really become famous! I grabbed the camera nad started napping pictures, trying to be attentive. I thought there was some refleciton from the windwo and I saw some smudges so I was thinking wow I hope these are coming out! In the end I took about 200 pictures and several minutes of video.

It was funny because when we landed the camera was left in the module to burn up in the atmosphere. WE brought bac the memory cards. When we landed the Russians requested me to surrender the memory cards to the commander of the Russina spacecraft, and he was instructed to leave them in the capsule. I didn't understand why they did this because I wanted to see them immediently but by doing this they were closed up int eh capusle which was being transported from Kazakhstan so Moscow IT took sometime to get them, there's a bigcommittee that sits in Moscow and opens the hatcha nd pulls out thingg> In the past things have disappeared and broekn so a big committee pulls out everything and classifies everything that's suposed to be there. things astronauts brought back. They checked, marked verifited and certified everything but when this was all done, more than 15 days after landign I was scared I was thinking th ereason tehy wer enot releasing them is because they have screwed up and lost them but then they came out and it was fine. PHew!

HIW: Will you, or would you like to go into space again?

PN: Well, if I had a choice I would love to go up for another mission. I feel now that I know what's going on up there so I would love todo things idferently pace myself better and enjoy things more. The reality is that flight opportunites are scarce even more so for Europeans and we have young atronauts that have never flown so it's kidn of a situation where many things go into the descition preocess. At this piont I would like to group again and I'm ready if that were to be the case but if not I have been to space and I have been so lucky to realie a dream I've had since I was a kid and I'm graeful fro that.

no no he still hsa time to get out. he just needs somebody to wave him off


Jim lovell and pete conrad
pull up neil! pull up now! pull up! 

everbody
shh

The room quites down as their attention is once again focused on the tv inages. Jim lovell is watching intensly as he imagines what it must be like to step on teh lunar surface. the only sound that can beheard is that which is coming from the television

the camera flies over the top of the vab and stops on the open hanger door and a parrtially stacked saturn booster sitting on the mlp

kennedy flirday october 201969

here is how the movie deviates from teh actual mission. the vab was known as the vertical assembly building until the space shuttle erea when it became the vehical asembly building

jim lvoell
the astronaut is only the most visible member fo ta very large team. and all of us right down to the guys sweeping the floor are honored to be a part of it. what did tahe man sa? give me a fever long enough and ill move the world. well, that's exactly kwhat were doing here the th;is is divien inspiration folks. its the best part of each one of urs to believ ethat natyhing is possible things like a computer that can fit into a single rooma nd hold millions of pieces of information or the saturn v rocket this is the actual alunch vehical that will be taking alan shpeared and his crew on the first leg of the apollo 13 mission. 

int vehical asembly cat walk situation day

standing on a cat walk on the sla level jim lvoell is conducint ga tour of the vab for a group of assorted vips.

congressman
when are you going up again jim

jim lovell
im slated to be the commander fo apollo 14 sometime late next year

congressman
...if thre is an apollo 14..now jim, ppl in my state have been asking whywere continuing to fund this program now that weve beaten th russians to the moon

jim lovell
imagine if christopher columbus had come back form the new world and no one returned in his footsteps

VOICE ON PA SYSTE
attention all personel! clear level three clear level three

a part of the CSM is lowered into position on top of the SLA as the Saturn V is being stacked in the VAB as the tour watches

[HEre is how the movie departs from the actual mission. The mating of the Saturn stages in the VAB happens much too fast]

jim lovell
are there any questions

women on tour
how do u go to the bathroom in space

jim lovell 
well i'll tell u. it's a highly tehcnical proess of cranking down the window and looking for a cas station which is..oh, there's deke slayton. deke, you might be able to answer this lady's question better than I. Deke is on of the orignal Mercury 7 astronauts. Ladies and Gentelmen. And now here's our boss, he ahnds out the astronauts' flight assignments. so naturally we kick back part of ours alareis to Deke very month. How much this month, Deke?

int. lovell home - day

the front door sinwgs open as an excited jim lovell searches the house for someone to share the good news with

jim lovell
hey anybody home?!

somebody to love perforemd by jefferson airplane plays from teh stero in barbars room

a discussion is going on i barbaras roomb etween marily nad barbara lovell voer halloween ostumes

marilyn lovell
barbra, mabye. i dont understand but you ar enot wearing that outin this neighbohrhood that's the end of this. i don't wanna hear it

jim lovell
hey everbody

marilyn lovell
jim!

jim lovell
marilyn. trick or treat. u know that easter vation trip we had palnned for acapulco?

marilyn
uh huh

jim lovell
i was thinking, ther emight be a slight change in destination

marilyn lovell
really

jim lovell
maybe..say the moon..al shepards ear infection has flared up and we've all been bumped up to the prime crew of apollo 13. straight to the head of the line and the fa maura highlands

here is how the movie departs from teh actual mission. the actual reaosn fora ssignign al shepard toa pollo 14 instead of apollo 13 was not his inner ear, buthis lack of trianing cominbed with relativley short time utnil launch. flying shepard on a later lgith would give his crew more time to train

marilyn lovell
six months. damn ur loving up six months

barbra lovell
dad can i pls wear this

jim lovell
sure!

marilyn lovell
jim!

no, absolutley not!

barbra lovell
this stinks!

marilyn lovell
they are not rushings things are they? i mean, you're gonna be ready in six months?

jim lovell
we'll be ready. oh hell, i wouldn't want to be around al shepard tonight. I gotta get over there. we're gonna have to getup to speed on this

the glass on teh indicators begin to break and float in the cm

ken mattingly
oh god help!

the cms hatch is forced open by the increased pressure build up in the cabin. paper and other debris rush out through teh open hatchway. a blue hose connected to one of the astronauts space suits comes undone. jim lovell is hanging from teh nad hol din teh open hatch as oxygen contiues to rush past him and out into the vacuum of space. suddenly a support inside the cm breask loose and flies through teh hatch knocing jim lovell into sapce. jim is bumbling helplessly end over end as hi is seperated from the cm at a very high rate.

title march 23 1970 3 weeks prior to launch

jim lvoell
something bad might happen. stars will fall down on you or something

jeffrey lovell
thats silly. stars can't fall on us. 

jim lovell
oh you are a smarter kid than i was

jeffery lovell
how long will it take you to go to the moon?

jim lovell
four days. but that's pretty fast you see. this is the satrun ivb booster and its shoots usup away from the earth pssh. its fast as a bullet from agun. until the moon's gravity actually grabs us and pulls us into a circle around the moon which is called an orbit. all riht? freda nd i wfloat down the tunnel into this guy- the lunar module. this is a psiderly looking guy. only holds two people and its just forl anding on the moon. and i take the controls and i steer it around and if ly it dwon adjusting ithere the attitude here pitch roll for anic soft alndign on the moon. better than eil armstrong. way beter thanpete conrad. 

jeffrey lovell
dad did u know the astronauts in teh fire?

jim lovell
yeah yeah i did. i knew the astronauts in teh fire. all of em

jeffrey lovell
could that happen again?

well, i'll tell u something about hta fire. um. a  lotta thing went wrong. the door, it's called a hatch. they couldnt get it open when they needed to get out. that was one thing and a well a lot of things went wrong in that fire

jeffrey lovell
did they fix it

oh yes, absolutely we fixed it. its not a problem anymore
