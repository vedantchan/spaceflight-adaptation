% Simluated annealing approach for generating surrogate data (time series)
% Implementation is way from optimal
% Example implementation using max discrepancy of periodic autocorrelation function
%
% Important difference to TISEAN implementation: the algorithm terminates when
% energy has converged, irrespective of the accuracy
%
% Set random seed using rand('seed',s)
%
% Usage: [Xs,T0] = generate_anneal (X, n_it, alpha, T0, ep, n_succ)
%	n_it	Maximal number of iterations per temperature
%	alpha	Cooling factor
%	T0	Initial temperature (set to [] for automatic procedure)
%	ep	Maximal number of cooling iterations
%	n_succ	Minimal number of successive successful iterations
%			before next cooling step
