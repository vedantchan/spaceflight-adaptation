This is a collection of matlab functions for generating so-called
`surrogate time series'.  They are basically realisations of a given
`original' time series (first input argument) under the assumption of a
certain null hypothesis, H0.  Traditionally, they are used for testing
the presence of nonlinearities in time series.  A *very* interesting
overview of surrogate data generation methods is:

Schreiber, T. and Schmitz, A. (2000), Surrogate Time Series, Physica D,
142, 346--382.

which can be downloaded from:
http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~schreibe/myrefs/myrefs.html

The basic idea is to compute a test statistic, t, for the original time
series, X, and on a number of surrogate time series, Xs, yielding t_o
and {t_s}.  The null hypothesis, H0, is rejected if t_0 is significantly
different from {t_s}, e.g. using a (left-, right- or two-tailed)
rank-based test.

These functions are implementations of different surrogate data generation
methods (described in Schreiber and Schmitz, 2000).

Maybe the DVV toolbox could be worth looking at in the context of 
signal nonlinearity testing:

I have added a number of surrogate data generation methods for other
applications.  For those interested, I have added the refs to the papers
where they are described/used.

These surrogates retain the empirical distribution of the original
data, and the instantaneous correlation to a given reference data set.
They can be used for checking if there are relations between data sets
that cannot be explained from simple correlations.

The null hypothesis underlying this type of surrogate is that the original
time series is stationary.  Basically, it generates a sequence of time
segments of random length, taken from the original time series.
